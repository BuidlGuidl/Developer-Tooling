    "description": "\n \"In the solitary nights, in the tranquility of the dark night, our minds let go and seek pleasant rest and serenity. Once again, the hidden and profound forces of our minds appear and remove the mask of truth.  In these solitudes, we initiate imagination and deep thinking. We may be looking for meaning and purpose in life, or delve into spirituality and soul-searching. Philosophy helps us ask bigger questions in our quest to understand the world and existence.  In the search for answers and deep meanings, in these solitudes, we find ourselves in a magical connection with our essence. There, we become more familiar with the language of the heart and the unspoken language and establish a connection with our inner silence.  In the nocturnal solitudes, the light of our souls blossoms in the darkness, and we engage in the occupation of becoming better human beings. In this renewed view of the world, we may see fresh, beautiful, and inspiring landscapes.  Let's make use of the nocturnal solitudes to advance our spiritual evolution and gain more insight and awareness of ourselves and the world.\"  We delve into a deeper world, seeking feedback from true existence. Hidden within us are the big questions to understand the meaning of existence, truth, and justice. In this philosophical journey, our minds grow more than ever, and our eyes gaze at the stars of knowledge and wisdom.  But often, the destruction of our perspectives follows. Where is the guarantee of the right path? Is it within ourselves or in others? Should we connect with others or commit suicide in solitude? The things we seek refuge in inherently lack meaning, and in the external world, we think most of the time about the stories of the sun worshipers and the ash worshipers.  With forms and sufferings, joys and sorrows, we reach the breadth and bounty of experience in the solitude of the night. We become prey turned butterfly, penetrating through a thread of fiery red initiative.  And in the end, in complete sobriety, we rise and discover the eight knots. Each sitting and brief reflects an extraordinary world, the salt ruling over all aspects of existence, and the honey-hearted reminder.  In search of a deeper meaning and harmony with being, we join the true awareness in the final wave of the night from the solitude to the reality, mapping artistic depictions with enthusiasm and profound monasticism. ‚ú®üååüîçüåüüé®üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\" ‚ú® Digital painting üñºÔ∏è  procreate üñåÔ∏è 5000 x 6000 px"

    "description": "Yohaku is a project to promote community contribution activities using cutting-edge decentralized technologies, born from the terraced rice paddy restoration efforts in the Ueyama area of Mimasaka City, Okayama Prefecture. The Ueyama area is a beautiful \"satoyama\" with about 8,300 terraced rice paddies, but due to depopulation and aging, the number of abandoned farmland is increasing, making it difficult to maintain the terraced rice paddies that boast a thousand years of history. Furthermore, it is a region where the issues faced by rural Japan, such as cultural inheritance, town maintenance, lack of successors, and the dilution of local communities, are concentrated. Yohaku uses blockchain technology to solve these regional issues, increasing the number of people who support the region and providing a mechanism to properly evaluate their contributions.\n\nSpecifically, Yohaku NFT will be issued to new participants, and the reporting of contribution activities will be reflected in EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service). Users who have made a certain contribution will be issued an NFT to prove it, and will be able to manage it with TBA (Token Bound Account). The four main features of Yohaku are \"self-governance,\" \"scalability,\" \"succession,\" and \"outcome-oriented.\" We believe that the future of the region should be decided by the people involved in the region, that digital technology can overcome geographical and community constraints, that the contributions of each individual can be passed on to the next generation, and that concrete results should be evaluated. In particular, the \"succession\" mechanism allows the accumulation of contributions to be passed on to the next bearer with the approval of multiple users when the current holder is unable to continue regional activities due to circumstances, enabling community contributions across generations. Yohaku will first conduct a demonstration experiment in the Ueyama area through NFT distribution challenges and actual regional activities, and then expand the model to other areas. In the future, we will promote collaboration with other regions facing similar issues by making it open source. Yohaku is an ambitious project that challenges regional issues and sustainable community building with the power of decentralized technology. The new approach, which is based on the spontaneous activities of local people while supporting them with digital technology and fostering them as an \"unstoppable infrastructure\" across generations, may become a model case for regional revitalization in Japan."

    "description": "Traditionally, price oracles are deployed on a per network basic (on each rollup individually). This manual deployment process can be lengthy, expensive, and may require legal agreements to be signed. Furthermore, prices are pushed to each rollup in a siloed manner, repeatedly incurring all associated overhead. Overall, there is a lot of duplicate computation taking place despite the underlying price data being identical. The traditional oracle architecture is unscalable in a world of 1000s of Rollups.\n\nGelato's 1-Click Price Oracles are natively integrated into rollups. These native oracles are immediately available without any manual deployment process and hyper scalable by leveraging a unique property of the rollup architecture. Prices are published to- and verified by a single rollup (Hub) and disseminated to all other rollups (Spokes) whilst avoiding duplicate computation and all associated overhead.\n\nThe key insight making this possible is that rollups essentially act as indexers over the L1 allowing us to consume data such as emitted events in a process known as derivation. The derivation layer is a crucial component as it facilitates, among other things, deposits which are initiated on the L1 and executed on the L2. This is what allows users on the L1 to securely deposit tokens to the L2.\n\nHere is how a deposit works under the hood:\n\n- The user invokes a smart contract which locks up tokens on the L1 and emits a deposited event.\n- Whenever the rollup enters a new epoch (new L1 block), it iterates through transaction receipts in that block and fetches all deposited event logs.\n- For all deposited event logs, the rollup constructs corresponding deposit transactions which are included at the top of the next L2 block.\n\nGelato 1-Click Price Oracles fork and slightly modify the OP Stack to introduce an additional source to the derivation layer. We first deploy an L1PriceOracle smart contract which receives price updates from Pyth every two seconds via a Gelato Web3 Function. This smart contract is deployed once and shared between all rollups. It verifies the associated signature to ensure the price update is legitimate and emits a PricesUpdated event containing all updated price feeds. When the rollup enters a new epoch, in addition to iterating through all deposited event logs as before, it also iterates through all PricesUpdated event logs. Just like with deposits, the rollup then constructs a special top-of-block transaction which updates prices on the L2. This top-of-block transaction calls an L2PriceOracle predeploy smart contract which stores prices on-chain and exposes them via a Pyth-like interface.\n\nIn summary, prices are pushed to and verified by a single smart contract living on the L1. On every epoch, rollups essentially copy fresh prices from L1 to L2 during derivation. Since publishing & verification is done in a single place rather than by each rollup individually, we reduce the complexity of publishing & verification from O(n) to O(1). However, despite avoiding duplicate computation, publishing prices to an L1 such as Ethereum every two seconds is prohibitively expensive. Instead, prices are published to a cheaper L2, in our case Base, and consumed by 1-Click (Base) L3 rollups. Unlike traditional oracles, 1-Click Oracles actually perform better at scale since the costs of publishing & verifying the data is amortized between all rollups. In essence, the constant cost is divided between many rollups (1/N). In addition, whenever a price feed is introduced on the Hub (Base), it is instantly available on all 1-Click rollups without any additional work. This allows us to rapidly introduce new price feeds. For more detailed information, please read the documentation."

    "description": "‚Äú1099-DA‚Äù is an AI generated, interactive piece of art. It employs AI, game mechanics, humor, and NFTs to satirize the regulatory landscape of blockchain in the US. The project allows collectors to experience the overwhelming requirement of the newly proposed 1099-DA form. A low estimate of 8-9 Billion of these forms will be submitted to the IRS if the rules go into effect.\n\n\n‚Äú1099-DA‚Äù is composed of 1099 NFTs, which showcase caricature-like portraits of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel on different types of currency. The images were created using a series of custom trained Stable Diffusion models (more on the exact process below).\n\n\n‚Äú1099-DA‚Äù utilizes custom smart contracts to engage collectors with a parody of the proposed 1099-DA form. NFT owners can call the 'exchangeCurrency' function, altering their NFT‚Äôs metadata. Each NFT can be changed to show a different political appointee; Gensler, Yellen, or Werfel. Changing an NFT will create a satirical, AI-generated 1099-DA form. Collectors then have the opportunity to mint the 1099 as an NFT by calling the ‚Äòsubmit1099ToIRS‚Äô function. This not only adds another unique AI-generated NFT to their collection but allows them to experience the ridiculousness of generating and submitting these forms for simply ‚Äòexchanging‚Äô their NFT. The prompts and data used to create these fake documents are pulled from the meta-data of the NFTs in the project. This real-world use case of tracking input and output data for AI with NFTs is overlooked by current regulators.\n\n\nIf the ‚Äú1099-DA‚Äù collection ever hits a critical majority, where two-thirds of NFTs are changed to the same appointee, every NFT in the series will permanently lock to showcase that appointee. This mechanism is analogous to congress clarifying the regulatory landscape with a two-thirds vote. This is a twist for collectors as their NFTs may unpredictably shift from rare to common or vice-versa.\n\n\nBelow outlines the process used for creating the images of the NFTs. Each image is purely AI-generated, there was no post-processing (e.g. Photoshop) of any output images:\n\n\nSeveral V2.1-768px Stable Diffusion models were trained to generate distinct and iconic types of US currency from 1870s Gold Certificates to present day Federal Reserve Notes.\nThousands of currency images were generated and curated down to 12 based on their style and aesthetic. Particular attention was paid to curating images with similar framing and drop shadows (these were not added or changed in post processing software).\nNext several new Stable Diffusion models were trained to generate caricatures in the likeness of SEC Chair Gary Gensler, Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen, and IRS Commissioner Daniel Werfel.\nUsing Stable Diffusion‚Äôs Automatic1111 interface, humorous images of the appointees were inpainted onto the 12 currency types. 10,000+ images were generated and curated into a final set of 1099 for each appointee.\nFinally, for the rarest currency type, the Gold Certificate, the artist used a special process with inpainting in Automatic1111 to add the words ‚ÄúGold God.‚Äù This element was added purely in Stable Diffusion. No post-processing software (e.g. photoshop) was used on the output images."

Act specifications can be automatically proved equivalent to concrete implementations in EVM. For very simple contracts, Act specifications can be automatically generated from EVM bytecode.\n\nThis is an end-to-end pipeline that supports principled reasoning about high level properties of EVM bytecode. It supports reasoning about both correctness (e.g. accounting invariants) and economic properties (e.g. incentive compatibility). Act specifications serve as a high-level smart contract representation, allowing for easy integration of existing general purpose analysis and verification tooling into the EVM context."

    "description": "Aderyn is an open-source, public-good developer tool. It is a Rust-based solidity smart contract static analyzer designed to help protocol engineers and security researchers find vulnerabilities in Solidity code bases.\n\nAderyn integrates seamlessly into small and enterprise-level development workflows. It offers lightning-fast, command-line static analysis functionality and a framework for building custom detectors that adapt to any Solidity codebase.\n\nAderyn does three things really well:‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç\nIdentify Solidity Smart contract vulnerabilities: Cyfrin Aderyn quickly identifies potential vulnerabilities in Solidity code and highlights parts of the codebase for further investigation.\n\nSupports building custom detectors to suit your needs: Protocols and security researchers can use the Cyfrin Aderyn framework to build custom vulnerability detectors for any Solidity codebase.\n\nIdentify known issues and protect OP value: Competitive auditing platforms can use Cyfrin Aderyn to detect and filter out known issues inside protocol codebases, protecting customers' and auditors' time and value.\n\nWho is it for?\n\n1. Developers\nAs a new generation of developers enters the space, we (the security community) are responsible for using our knowledge and experience to create tools that facilitate secure development practices. We need to make it easy to avoid repeating past mistakes.\n\nFrom a developer's perspective, the cost of finding bugs in Solidity code is exorbitantly high. Engaging top-tier security firms like Cyfrin Private Audits or competitive audit platforms like CodeHawks requires serious cash. That's because the security knowledge required to stamp out bugs is pooled among security firms and competitive auditors, who are in demand.\n\nWe must drive the cost of finding bugs, especially the common and known ones, towards zero by creating tools that make development secure by nature.\n\nAderyn is built for lightning-fast, open-source static analysis that hooks into the existing development workflow.\n\n2. Security Researchers\nSecurity Researchers are the knowledge guardians of the on-chain world. They are the people you engage with when you're undergoing an audit. Many auditors start every audit with a long checklist. They read through the codebase, ensuring the code doesn't violate any items on their list. If it does, it's an issue for the report. Once they've finished with this list, they get creative and try out other techniques.\n\nAderyn's detector framework enables Security Researchers to encode the patterns they look for in their checklist into Aderyn detectors. By doing this, the research community can focus on the deeper, more complex bugs, knowing that tooling has uncovered the repetitive checklist of issues so they don't have to.\n\nDevelopers write more secure code before they engage Security Researchers, and when they do, the Researchers can spend more time on complex bugs instead of manually checking for easy fixes.\n\nWhat makes Aderyn unique vs similar tools?\nSpeed: Real-time feedback as you‚Äôre coding with the upcoming vscode extension.\n\nCutting-edge detectors: The detectors are built from the latest findings from external and in-house auditors. This means developers can harness the power of an audit team at their fingertips for free!\n\n‚ÄúAuditor Mode‚Äù: Helps auditors find specific areas and concepts within a codebase to dig further. For example, ‚ÄúShow me all of the instances in which this storage slot is altered‚Äù.\n\nOpen-source: This tool is completely open-source and will be free for all developers in perpetuity. Cyfrin does not make money directly from it.\n\nAdoption of tool: Aderyn is now used by developers across the Superchain ecosystem and we are continuously building new custom detectors for developers. \n\nImportance of tool: Security is paramount for mass adoption. Without security, adding any TVL to the Superchain is risky. We want to support developers from day zero and provide real time security analysis whilst projects are being built.\n\nSuperchain interoperability: We want to ensure that when working cross chain, builders are doing so with secure frameworks. We also include building customer detectors for interoperability. \n\nWho are Cyfrin:\nCyfrin is the industry-leading smart contract education and security company. Home to 8,000 security researchers and a community of over 100,000 students and smart contract engineers, we provide audits, tools, and education to the world's biggest decentralized protocols, institutions, and products.\n\nCyfrin works closely with Optimism and the Superchain as a whitelisted security service provider. We want to continue adding value to the Optimims ecosystem. \n\nThis project refers specifically to Cyfrin's developer tool, Aderyn."

As Head of Media, I assisted in developing the marketing and structure for our on-chain summer experience. \n\nDuring OnChain Summer, Ancurated spearheaded multiple groundbreaking projects on the Superchain, highlighting diverse talents from Africa and the African Diaspora. We believe in the critical importance of safeguarding and amplifying these interconnected stories, breaking barriers to showcase the vast and diverse artistic expressions from across the African continent and beyond. Our mission is clear: Africa is not a monolith but a continent of vast influence and creativity that resonates globally.\n\nKey Projects:\n\nAncollective: We launched Ancollective, an African-based guild fostering a vibrant community for the next generation of African artists on the blockchain. Ancollective is now one of the largest African-based accounts on Zora, with a following of 3.5k. Through this platform, we‚Äôve onboarded 15 artists from various regions of Africa. As part of ancollective, we also developed their own digital zine \"The Community Chronicle.\" Our special \"Africa Day\" edition achieved 213 mints and attracted 163 collectors, a record that underscores the impact of our efforts to educate and celebrate African history, created through the support of AI technology and IRL stories.

We believe DeFi and Web3 can change the financial landscape with the right infrastructure and access to meaningful real-world data.\n\nAPI3 pioneered first-party oracles operated by data providers, removing the middleman and serving data directly to the chain. In price feeds, this means a collection of well-known data providers verifiably serves individual price updates to Metis, before being aggregated on-chain. In a first-party architecture, every data source can be verified, optimizing for transparency and increasing the security of a Price Oracle.\n\nMoreover, API3 launched our decentralized price feeds in September 2023, and since then, we have grown our TVS to over $1 billion, with 25+ DeFi protocols integrated.\n\nAPI3‚Äôs OEV recapture solution, the OEV Network, will enable these protocols to recapture significant value by redirecting MEV currently leaked back to the protocol.\n\nExpanding on the above, Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) is a subset of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) that occurs within on-chain liquidations. Currently, liquidations in lending markets are very inefficient, with significant amounts of collateral being passed to block producers (validators). The OEV Network is a solution that makes liquidations more efficient by using a dAPI price feed.\n\nThis means that, for the first time, protocols can generate value through their oracle. For larger lending markets, we estimate this equates to millions of dollars in value recapture per year, bringing significant benefits to this vertical within DeFi.\n\nAs implied by the deterministic addresses, the following contract deployments also belong to us, yet we were not able to verify them\nhttps://basescan.org/address/0xa0AD79D995DdeeB18a14eAef56A549A04e3Aa1Bd\nhttps://fraxscan.com/address/0x709944a48cAf83535e43471680fDA4905FB3920a"

    "description": "Ah, the melodious intonation of the word \"fool,\" a term that has tickled the tongues of jesters and philosophers alike! To articulate it correctly is an art form, a delicate balance between playful derision and affectionate teasing.\n\nFirst, let us prepare the stage for our vocal cords, for they are the unsung heroes in this comedic concerto. Begin with a furrowed brow and a knowing smirk, as if you're about to unveil the universe's greatest secret, or perhaps just remembered a particularly funny joke at an inopportune moment.\n\nNow, for the grand performance: The 'f' should escape your lips like a mischievous whisper, the soft harbinger of hilarity to come. It's the gentle rustle of a jester's bells, the sly wind before the storm of snickers.\nAs we glide into the 'oo,' let it roll out like a red carpet of ridicule, stretching long and full of pomp. This is the heart of the word, the soulful song of the scamp. It should resonate with the roundness of a court jester's belly, full from feasting on the folly of others.\n\nFinally, we arrive at the 'l,' the crisp finale, the flick of the trickster's wand. It should not be a harsh 'l,' but rather a soft landing, a subtle nod to the buffoonery that has just danced upon our lips.\n\nAnd there you have it, a fool said with such grace and gusto that it almost seems a compliment. Remember, to say \"fool\" with the right lilt is to walk the tightrope between jest and jab, a verbal wink that lets the listener in on the joke. It's a word that, when wielded with humor and irony, can turn the most stoic of faces into a canvas of chuckles.\n\nNow go forth and practice this artful articulation, for the world is in dire need of fools, pronounced ever so foolishly, to keep the solemn specter of seriousness at bay."

For that reason, Ethereum has long supported multi-client implementations, and in L2, we need a multi-proof system to fully achieve them.\n\nTest in Prod has been supporting OP Stack to pioneer the multi-client system. We helped execution clients diversify with OP Erigon and have also been working on fault-proof systems diversify with Asterisc.\n\nWe have been working on the following:\n- Upon Protolambda‚Äôs initial implementation, we finished implementing all required opcodes & fixed bugs.\n- Built test suites to run Asterisc against OP Sepolia & OP Mainnet.\n- Ran all blocks of OP Sepolia with Asterisc to verify its deployability on OP Sepolia.\n- Deployed Asterisc to OP Sepolia with cold path.\n- Implementing a different memory structure from Cannon using Radix trie so that Asterisc can save the system when there‚Äôs a problem with existing memory implementation.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries for Asterisc:\n\nClabby (Senior Software Engineer from OP Labs): Asterisc is critical to the OP Stack‚Äôs multi-proof roadmap, serving as the compliment to cannon in the landscape of FPVMs. After the rollout of multi-proofs, it will add redundancy to the virtual machine component that runs the fault proof programs, reducing the likelihood of critical impact in the event of an issue with either the on-chain or off-chain FPVM implementations."

The DeFi ‚ÄúRWA‚Äù market is rapidly growing, with TVL in assets reaching +$8 billion and being one of the main sources of DeFi growth. \n‚Üí Having such an infrastructure is one of the most important ways to onboard trillions of existing assets into a public blockchain/L2.

We came to Mode chain 2 months ago, with a new asset-backed credit pool ready with commited capital from our lender base, and it was subscribed up to USDC $5.5m with a 6 month lockup. Our lenders bridged to Mode to access this deal, and we are currently opening new ones. \n\n\nATLENDIS UNIQUE FEATURES \n\nProven Track Record: $15M in loans originated with no defaults on Fintech, Market Makers, Asset Managers and Funds. \n\nDiverse Lender Base: 6000+ active lenders, including retail users, asset managers, HNWI and hedge funds.\n\nSecurity and Compliance: Audits by Runtime Verification, PeckShield, Trail of Bits, and Nethermind. \n\nStrategic Positioning: Atlendis is one of the only KYCed/KYBed RWA protocols not limited to crypto-native companies or market makers on any Layer 2. This unique positioning attracts sticky capital (locked for 6 months to a year on our opportunities) and a diverse range of borrowers and lenders. Onboarding lenders is longer and more difficult for us as any wallet needs to pass KYC or KYB before participating in our deals (and $100 minimum amount), but this is also a crucial part of infrastructure to bridge TradFi and DeFi that we brought to Mode. \n\nComprehensive Operational/Legal Framework: Atlendis Flow is a registered Digital Assets Services Provider (DASP) by the AMF in France, allowing us to conduct on/off-ramp and FX business and seamlessly bridge traditional finance with DeFi. \nWe can natively on/off ramp all major currencies from an L2 with Circle integrated. \n\n‚Üí We are capable of conducting asset-backed and senior secured deals globally with a full offchain to onchain stack."

In our paper, we focus on the various types of attacks they face. Specifically, we examine historical attacks on DAOs, theorized attack vectors, and potential attacks that were identified and mitigated through audits across different blockchain ecosystems. For each of these (potential) attacks, we describe and categorize the utilized attack vectors into four categories. Our analysis reveals that while many attacks on DAOs exploit the less tangible and more complex human dynamics involved in governance, audits tend to concentrate primarily on code and protocol vulnerabilities. To provide ongoing insights into the risks DAOs encounter, we maintain an up-to-date dataset at www.daoattacks.ethz.ch.\n\nAdditionally, we distill a set of key risk factors for DAOs and empirically examine the vulnerabilities of 26 DAOs, including the Token House of the Optimism DAO. We open-source the code used for this analysis. Finally, we propose mitigation strategies aimed at safeguarding DAOs against these vulnerabilities."

TVL: $12.5M (capped at 15M)\n\nNote: all protocol stats can be verified onchain as well as at: analytics.avantisfi.com\n\nWhile there are several off-chain or hybrid exchanges available, we firmly believe in constructing a completely on-chain future through a permissionless platform for both RWAs and crypto assets, fueled by LPs and traders. We‚Äôre exclusive to the Superchain, committed to building a sustainable exchange long-term, and are just getting started.\n\nIn under a year of our mainnet launch, we've established ourselves as one of the leading destinations for Superchain (and specifically Base network) perp traders and LPs. We plan to keep going deeper into the Base stack, having already integrated Coinbase Pay to onramp users seamlessly, and are in the process of integrating CB smart wallets. We have three simple goals: \n\n1) RWA Adoption: Get more real world asset traders onchain. We've already listed Forex (including Turkish Lira), Metals like Gold, Silver & plan to bring global assets like crude oil onchain in the near future. \n2) Superchain as a Derivatives Hub: Make Base (and the Superchain) the premier destination for onchain perpetuals trading and market-making. \n3) Democratize market-making: Provide competitive and safe yields for USDC LPs on Base, while giving them custom risk management tools. That is, we want to allow passive LPs the opportunity to market-make complex derivatives the same way institutions do, which is the true and original promise of DeFi. \n\n\n\n\n"

    "description": "We have developed a signer proxy software that enables the OP Stack chain to use an external signer (currently supporting AWS KMS and YubiHSM) through the official signer client to signer the sequencer, batcher, proposer and challenger transactions. However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger. We are working with them to make signer proxy perfect and production ready."

    "description": "My name is Aspyn and I'm an onchain NFT artist. I like to explore what blockchain art can do that real world art can not do.\n\nMy project is Based NFTs, which are a series of composable interactive fully onchain NFT collections that I created on Base. The metadata and art for all of these collections is stored fully onchain and each collection is composable onchain, meaning the art for each NFT can be included in another onchain collection simply by referencing the NFT's smart contract.\n\nThe first collection was a limited supply collection representing the first fully onchain interactive version of Steamboat Willie, titled Onchain Steamboat Willie. With Onchain Steamboat Willies, the art is composable, which means other onchain NFT collections could use the Steamboat Willie art in their art simply by referencing the Onchain Steamboat Willie smart contracts. Onchain Steamboat Willies minted out with a supply of 1111. \n\nThis takes us to my next collection: Pop Willies.\n\nPop Willies are onchain generative pop art that blend the old school, iconic hand-drawn Steamboat Willie with blockchain-enabled digital art composability. Each Pop Willie is created from multiple Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs. By minting a Pop Willie NFT, you'd also receive the 4 (or 9) Onchain Steamboat Willie NFTs that make up your Pop Willie's art. Furthermore, at any point, if you collect a new Onchain Steamboat Willie, you could add that Steamboat Willie your Pop Willie NFT's art by simply calling the \"paintWillies4\" function on the Pop Willies smart contract, allowing you to forever modify your NFT's art through onchain art composability. Pop Willies minted out with a supply of 300.\n\nThe third collection is Based Moon, which was an open edition dropped on both X and (via open-source frame) on Farcaster. I believe Based Moon is the first fully onchain moon art on Base that updates its phase in real-time with the phase of the real world moon by using the current block-time. The Based Moon open edition mint concluded with 1805 moons minted.\n\nFor my day job, I am a protocol engineer at OpenSea. During my free time, I work on NFT projects and various crypto-related experiments."

Over 1000 addresses were confirmed to have onboarded ETH to Base in the first 48 hours of the networks public launch, all in order to receive a Basic Dog Meme airdrop. This activity provided the substantial bulk of newly active wallets on the first day.\n\nSince then, Basic Dog Meme has:\n- Assisted Aerodrome's team with finding the correct metrics and guidelines for meme coins to be onboarded to their platform.\n- Pioneered MemeFi by being the first Meme coin with a gauge on Aerodrome. \n- Endlessly evangelized the benefits of meme coins utilizing Aerodrome, Base's liquidity hub. Initially it took some time to get the other Meme's on-board, but eventually it became standard practice to take advantage of Aerodrome's flywheel. All because of Basic Dog Meme.\n- Rallied a community of thousands of enthusiasts, from diverse block chains and backgrounds, to bridge to Base.\n- Become an ambassador of the arts by being a patron to dozens of NFT artists who love the color blue\n- Was the focus of one of the first community initiatives to create a meme-coin driven L3 on Base, perhaps serving as the originator of that idea within the base community. Although Basic Meme Chain is still in the development phase, the idea that was later executed and expanded upon by multiple other meme coin communities. The explosion of meme-chains on Base happened mere days after we shared the idea with the world on twitter.\n"

An artwork that is never finished, an artwork that is always growing into something bigger. An artwork that evolves as time goes by. \n\nI imagine it as a digital \"cave painting\"...

Find the initial group of artists to create the first piece and spend time planning the next phases. \n\nI'd like to spend some time brainstorming with different artists to see how they feel about the project and if they would want to collaborate. Since this all takes time I'd like to request an initial capital to cover the costs so I can focus on this project and the research full-time. "

It's basically a Reddit, and anyone can create their own space for any topic without permission and it's completely unstoppable. All contents and replies can be upvoted with ETH (because they are all Bodhi assets). Released in April 2024, Bodhi Space had over 90 different spaces in less than 2 days.\n\nWe'll build more protocols on Bodhi with developers from all over the world, covering different fields.

Apps like https://www.interested.fyi/ and an open source FC client are using a beta version of the API to combat bot-like activity.\n\nAnd in an attempt to make the data more openly accessible Bot or Not has started to attest classifications on Base using the Ethereum Attestation Service: https://base.easscan.org/schema/view/0x4fad2c558294b9b0d587d7047ccdd8ffbf3f14c0c03bc28471e1a72aef678747\n\nThe cast action‚Äôs original intent was to help Farcaster users quickly decipher if someone had bot-like casting behavior before they engaged with them. Using a combination of cast history and AI, Bot or Not classifies users and provides a summary of their casting habits so that people can decide for themselves if they want to engage or not.\n\nSince launch, Bot or Not has expanded beyond just the cast action. The database of information on FID classifications is now used to power: \nFarcaptcha - a Captcha frame that is used to combat bot-like activity.\nSimple Mod - anti-bot channel moderation that channel owners can set up entirely in frame.\nReply stats - a frame that breaks down how many of your recent replies are from bot-like accounts vs non-bot accounts"

    "description": "Botto is a decentralized autonomous artist governed by BottoDAO. Thousands of DAO members vote on Botto's artworks on a weekly basis, providing training data to Botto's art engine. Once per week, the artwork with the most votes is auctioned off, with 50% of all auction proceeds being redistributed in ETH to the voters. The DAO participates in collective meaning making, questioning the notion of \"good art\" while being incentivized to align itself with the question \"what would sell\".\n\nIn order to more broadly distribute access to Botto, the DAO has ran community campaigns in the past, distributing a \"Botto Access Pass\". An Access Pass grants its holder with governance rights in the form of voting on the artist, and acts as an entry point into Botto's ecosystem. The DAO recently created a new ERC-1155 contract to bring the Access Pass to Base, providing a free mint to any voting participant on Farcaster via Frames. Over 9600 voting participants joined in on this meaning making process.\n\nIn the coming two months, the DAO will be bridging the BOTTO token (ERC-20) from Mainnet to Base, providing protocol owned liquidity to continue our journey on democratizing art. Accompanying this, the DAO is to offer all users the ability to claim its voting rewards in ETH. Finally, the DAO is launching a questing system native to Base, where new project entrants (starting with Base Access Pass holders!) the ability to earn the protocol‚Äôs native token, $BOTTO, simply by participating in training Botto. We see Botto as a playful, digestible point of entry for users new and old. TL;DR ‚Äì we‚Äôre very excited to continue building on Base and can‚Äôt wait to launch what we‚Äôve been working on!"

    "description": "Shutter is a threshold encryption protocol with a wide variety of applications, including: malicious MEV prevention, censorship resistance, voting integrity, and gaming fairness.\n\nShielded Trading.\n\nShielded Trading is the main focus on Shutter Network, we aim to provide a solution for front-running prevention through transaction encryption using threshold cryptography-based distributed key generation (DKG). An encrypted mempool prevents the parts of MEV that are considered malicious (front-running, sandwich attacks) while leaving the distribution of the benign types of MEV (arbitrage, liquidations).\n\nEnd users, especially from DEXs and DEFI, benefit the most from shielded mempools. It strikes the best balance between ensuring market efficiency and minimizing malicious MEV. In other words, users enjoy a higher degree of base layer neutrality leading to a) better and fairer prices on DEXs and DeFi protocols due to front-running protection and b) an additional censorship resistance layer.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the encrypted mempool adds base layer neutrality and ensures that the sequencer's role remains impartial, making it impossible for end users or regulators to accuse the sequencer or other involved parties of market manipulation. The encryption of the mempool obscures transaction details, preventing any party from manipulating or censoring transactions based on their content. Ensuring that the transaction order is free from interference and aligns with regulatory goals of maintaining fair and transparent market practices, potentially fostering a more cooperative relationship between blockchain networks and regulatory bodies. This minimizes regulatory threats; for example, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation MICA could treat front running and other types of MEV as ‚Äúmarket abuse‚Äù (https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1795084797238256110)\n\nShutter performed a feasibility study for Front-running protection via shielded mempool for OP Stack using threshold encryption (https://gov.optimism.io/t/shutterized-optimism-an-encrypted-mempool-for-the-op-stack/) and we are currently developing a module for the OP Stack. We are also in talks with multiple L2s, RaaS (Rollops as a Service) and shared sequencer projects to integrate mempool/transaction encryption on their solutions and integrations. They have already announced a partnership with Espresso to introduce an encrypted mempool for the Espresso sequencer network.\n\nShielded Voting. \n\nShutter protects DAO votes from manipulation by whales. Votes are encrypted when cast and revealed after the voting period ends.\n\n\nShielded Voting is integrated with Snapshot, it is currently used by 382 unique communities. It has protected over 2,330 proposals and 216,805 casted votes.\n"

Just as on the blockchain - in this project - BRIDGE event is a way of bridging the two distant hemispheres and their artist communities, who are joining forces in this massive collective art release.\nThe BRIDGE code-word with its multiple meanings is the cornerstone of our mission to unite distant regions and build a borderless Web3 community that thrives on diversity and innovation.\nThis project also aims to bridge the disparities in representation within the art scene between the Global South and the West, seeking to transcend inequalities caused by differing political, economic, and cultural contexts. With this project we want to provide equal opportunities for all artists, and create a more balanced and interconnected global art community that celebrates diversity and different origins as its greatest strength.\nWe see BRIDGE as a symbol of unity, transformation, progress and endurance.\nThe BRIDGE drop occurring at the transition from the old to the new year, symbolizes bridging the past and future while embracing a creative intersection of tradition and innovation in the art world.\nWith our synchronized drop, we hope to make a significant impact shaping the Web3 landscape, while celebrating its accessibility and the wide range of opportunities it offers.\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚¨•‚óÜ‚¨•‚îÄ‚îÄ \nFull info & credits of the BRIDGE Project: \n‚óÜ Concept, Art Statement & Organizing: V5MT ‚óÜ Promo - Animated Flyers + N3XTWAVE Mirror Profile: V5MT ‚óÜ Event Flyer: stipinpixel ‚óÜ VR Gallery initiative: Newtro ‚óÜ VR Gallery builders: UgoDigi & Datura - North side, + Eltito - South side + glb bridge: V5MT + later Eltito optimizing & installing it to connect both sides of the gallery ‚óÜ Release Date: January 3rd 2024 ‚óÜ Platform: zora.co ‚óÜ Network: ZORA ‚óÜ Featured Artists: N3XTWAVE: Bleu281, Francoise Gamma, V5MT, Datura, Jerome Allavena , Lucas Lejeune, Nicholas Dietrich, Ugo, k0ch, Mostwrongking, Element Lee + Newtro Represented LatAm Artists (selected collectively by N3XTWAVE members): cap'n, stipinpixel, mariana Ju, Pipi Universel, Ed Marola, m.suksu, Moranicol , Danyrus, Jotta.rs, Aura, Santiago Ruau.\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚¨•‚îÄ‚îÄ \nNotes:\n‚¨•I'm submitting this project from my personal Farcaster account, not N3XTWAVE, which I set up but didn't have time to manage.‚¨•Because we decided not to use a collaborative contract for this drop, (since it was a new feature and we weren‚Äôt sure how to implement it), I'm linking to my Mirror article with all the minted pieces embedded, instead of linking to Zora.‚¨•I plan to share the potential reward from this submission and distribute it to the artists accordingly."

Users can explore, checkin and earn rewards for discovering the world around them.\n  \nCheckin Demo:\nhttps://youtu.be/mGKibG2xfhA\n\n\n## Problem\n\nWe believe there is a disconnect between onchain identities and our IRL identities.\n\nOnchain data is only a small part of our identity; most of our lives are offchain or IRL data - IRL data has a lot of signal that can be added to onchain data.\n\nOur conviction is that in the future in order to have meaningful engagement with users, we need to bridge IRL/offchain activities to our onchain identities.\n  \nVision\n  \nCheckin is enriching digital identities by bridging IRL activities to onchain identity.  By tying IRL activities to wallets (e.g. earning a ‚ÄúRamen Lovers‚Äù badge checking into 5 ramen places), Checkin enables users to own their combined IRL and onchain identities, and builders can then create new and exciting experiences with this location/IRL-centric data. The highest signal of your interests is voting with your feet.  Being a location-centric social app that taps into onchain social graphs, we encourage people to be more social and touch grass with friends more often.\n\nWhen bridging IRL activities to onchain identities, users can benefit from better personalization when interacting with onchain projects. Projects benefit from improved engagement and conversions when they have more context on who their users are beyond financial transactions.\n\n  \n \nIRL Social Experiences:\n- At ETHCC this year a member of the Checkin community organized a Checkin Challenge tour where they selected a list of local places to ‚Äòcheckin‚Äô with other ETHCC attendees.  Over a dozen ETHCC attendees decided to make new friends and explore new surroundings using Checkin\n- We partnered with POAP to create ‚ÄúPOAP Rally Tokyo‚Äù where users can checkin to 9 shrines across Tokyo to earn cool POAPs and a chance to win one of 3 cool darumas designed by a local Japanese artist.  Extending on this we organized 2 walking tours of Tokyo where 20+ people signed up to touch grass and our spirits."

Initially, the Foundation handled violation reports, and Token House delegates voted on enforcement, but this model became unsustainable as the ecosystem grew. To address concerns about impartiality and delegate discomfort in voting on violations, the Council was formed, undergoing two rescopings to refine its role.\n\nNote: In the S5 scope for the role, it was intended that the majority of the funding be from RetroPGF. In S6, the budget was increased per member, and therefore that different team is not applying. From S5 budget: ‚ÄúEach Council member will receive a stipend of 3,000 OP at the end of the Season. As the activity level of the Code of Conduct Councils is unknown in advance (as it depends on the number of reports and disputes per Season), the majority of rewards for Code of Conduct Councils should be granted retroactively via RetroPGF.‚Äù "

This includes proof-of-stake consensus design, crypto-economic mechanism design, software simulations and experiments, spec writing, security assessments, testing, and more.\n\nHere are some of the projects and research directions that we have been involved with over the period covered by this RPGF round:\n\n- Inclusion lists: in the first half of 2024, an existing inclusion list proposal has been refined together with client teams, culminating in [EIP-7547](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7547), which was for a time considered for inclusion in Electra. Though that has not transpired, the work on EIP-7547 has still informed our understanding of the inclusion list design space. Eventually, this work has led to further research on more distributed inclusion list mechanisms, such as [FOCIL](https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870)\n\n- MaxEB: our team has greatly contributed to the development of the MaxEB proposal, both with [early research and security analysis](https://notes.ethereum.org/nHqON5l7SACkL_nPwz8Vqw) and with spec development. This has led to [EIP-7251](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7251), which has been included in the Electra fork. The MaxEB spec has meanwhile been incorporated in the [Electra spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/electra).\n\n- PeerDAS: research, spec writing and coordination of the development effort. Starting from last fall, many research posts have been written on the topic, culminating in the [PeerDAS spec](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/tree/dev/specs/_features/eip7594) as a feature in the Ethereum consensus specifications, and with the corresponding [EIP-7594](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7594) being considered for inclusion in the next fork. \n\n- Consensus protocol research: much research work has gone into the topic of Single Slot Finality, with papers, [ethresearch posts](https://ethresear.ch/t/orbit-ssf-solo-staking-friendly-validator-set-management-for-ssf/19928), a [wip high-level spec](https://github.com/fradamt/ssf) being worked on, among other things. \n\n- Staking economics: our team actively participates in research around staking economics and generally the future of staking.\n\n"

My story on the Internet began in 2015, working behind the scenes to take advantage of every opportunity and generate income in cryptocurrency. This allowed me to face the crisis that affected my country, Venezuela. In 2017, I was lucky to meet some wonderful people who I collaborated with as a columnist and community manager on Telegram and Discord. I also participated in very lucrative airdrops. Thanks to these experiences, I managed to overcome significant difficulties. Overall Concept: However, everything changed with the arrival of the Covid-19 pandemic. A year ago, an idea occurred to me: to work on an NFT project together with my 12-year-old daughter Georgina. Georgina has an innate talent for drawing, anime and graphic design. This is how our project was born: Cosmic Crooks. The concept behind Cosmic Crooks is a mix between Pokemon's Team Rocket and the world of cryptocurrencies. It has nothing to do with Pokemon, but is inspired by the idea of going beyond, like a rocket to the moon. Together, my daughter and I work hard every day, respecting her school schedule and responsibilities. We spend every free moment for 1 whole year generating concepts for our NFT project. Now, we're ready with the Collection of 3,000 PFPs. The images is created by hand on a Tablet and polished in Photoshop. Each PFP has their own unique and different personality from each other."

    "description": "Cryptocurrency is a form of digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments (fiat currency), cryptocurrencies are decentralized and typically operate on blockchain technology, a distributed ledger maintained by a network of computers (nodes).\n\nHere are some key aspects of cryptocurrency:\n\n### 1. **Blockchain Technology**\n   - The foundation of most cryptocurrencies is blockchain. It‚Äôs a decentralized, digital ledger that records all transactions across a network. Each \"block\" contains a list of transactions, and \"chains\" of blocks are linked together in a chronological order.\n   - Blockchain ensures transparency, security, and immutability, meaning once information is added, it cannot be altered.\n\n### 2. **Decentralization**\n   - Cryptocurrencies aren't controlled by a central authority like a bank or government. Instead, they rely on networks of computers (also called nodes) to validate transactions and manage the network. This decentralization is one of the key selling points of cryptocurrencies, as it makes them resistant to government interference and manipulation.\n\n### 3. **Cryptography**\n   - Cryptocurrencies use cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and control the creation of new units. This ensures that only authorized parties can perform transactions. Common cryptographic methods include public and private keys for digital wallets and hashing algorithms to secure the blockchain.\n\n### 4. **Popular Cryptocurrencies**\n   - **Bitcoin (BTC)**: The first and most well-known cryptocurrency. It was created by an anonymous person (or group) under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009. Bitcoin operates on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism.\n   - **Ethereum (ETH)**: A platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) using smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. Ethereum is transitioning from a proof-of-work to a proof-of-stake system (Ethereum 2.0) to improve scalability and reduce energy consumption.\n   - **Other Cryptocurrencies**: Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Cardano (ADA), and Solana (SOL) are examples of other popular cryptocurrencies, each with their own unique features and use cases.\n\n### 5. **Mining and Staking**\n   - **Mining**: The process of validating new transactions and adding them to the blockchain by solving complex mathematical problems. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency (such as Bitcoin) for their efforts. Bitcoin uses the proof-of-work (PoW) system for mining.\n   - **Staking**: In contrast, proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies require participants to hold and lock up a certain amount of cryptocurrency to validate transactions. Staking is seen as a more energy-efficient method of securing the network.\n\n### 6. **Use Cases and Applications**\n   - **Payments**: Cryptocurrencies can be used to transfer money across borders, often with lower fees and faster processing times than traditional methods.\n   - **Investment**: Many people buy cryptocurrencies as an investment, hoping their value will increase over time.\n   - **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**: DeFi is a movement that leverages cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology to recreate traditional financial services like lending, borrowing, and trading in a decentralized manner.\n   - **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)**: NFTs are unique digital assets representing ownership of items like art, music, and collectibles. They use blockchain to verify ownership.\n\n### 7. **Volatility and Risks**\n   - Cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility. Prices can swing dramatically in short periods, which presents opportunities but also risks.\n   - **Security Risks**: Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets are sometimes targeted by hackers. Users must take extra precautions to safeguard their holdings (e.g., using hardware wallets).\n   - **Regulation**: The regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is still evolving, with governments around the world debating how to treat them. This creates uncertainty for investors and businesses in the space.\n\n### 8. **Regulation and Legal Status**\n   - Cryptocurrencies are treated differently depending on the country. Some countries like El Salvador have adopted Bitcoin as legal tender, while others like China have imposed heavy restrictions or outright bans. In many countries, cryptocurrencies are treated as assets and subject to capital gains taxes.\n   - **Governments and regulators** are working to establish frameworks for cryptocurrency exchanges, anti-money laundering (AML) policies, and consumer protection.\n\n---\n\nIf you are interested in a particular cryptocurrency, want to know about a specific topic like how to buy or trade crypto, or want to understand how it works further, feel free to ask!"

The course is available at https://cryptozombies.io/en/optimism.\n\nWe're also building [CryptoZombies Apocalypse](https://apocalypse.cryptozombies.io/), an Optimism-based tower defense game where players fight zombie waves to save humanity.

Users no longer have to connect their cold wallets/vaults/multisigs to unknown websites, they can \"delegate once, use forever\". This reduces phishing risk and creates a safe NFT/DeFi ecosystem on Optimism, just as we've seen on Ethereum. We've also seen greatly improved UX - by safely interacting from a hot wallet or mobile wallet, users can do low-risk onchain activity like voting or gaming on the go. And onchain reputation, which is critical to Optimism Collective governance, is enhanced by identity clusters formed within the registry.\n\nOur solution is a programmable registry, deployed on Optimism and Base.  Users and institutions link their cold wallets with hot wallets on delegate.xyz, and then the hot wallet can act on behalf of the cold wallet, like crypto power-of-attorney.  This allows users to manage all their assets across multiple wallets simultaneously without touching anything in their vault, enhancing security and efficiency across airdrops, governance, gaming, DeFi, and more.  \n\nDelegate‚Äôs registry is fully onchain, enumerable, independent, immutable, and verifiable."

Thanks to Delta, we could see more OP Chains in production, as it reduced the minimal annual operating cost from 165 ETH to 5 ETH (97%). Delta is effective for low-active chains, but active chains, such as Zora, are saving up to 30% of fixed L1 costs with Span Batches.\n\nFor the Superchain‚Äôs success, reducing the fixed on-chain cost is important. Chain Governors have to take risks for the fixed costs, and it‚Äôs difficult to launch an OP Chain if it‚Äôs unbearable.

    "description": "**Requested Funding:** $5000\n\n## 1. Project Description\n\nDemeter is an open-source backtesting framework for DeFi on EVM chains, including Optimism's Superchain ecosystem. It empowers onchain builders‚Äîdevelopers crafting dApps for liquidity provision, lending, and trading‚Äîto test investment strategies and evaluate returns using real historical market data.\n\nCurrently, Demeter supports backtesting on key protocols like Uniswap V3, Aave V3, Deribit options, Squeeth, and GMX V2. Inspired by the Backtrader library, Demeter's intuitive design allows traditional financial engineers to quickly onboard, with optimizations for speed and real-world accuracy‚Äîcore calculations draw directly from protocol smart contract code rather than theoretical formulas, ensuring simulations mirror live chain behavior.\n\nDemeter simplifies Superchain interop for developers by providing a unified DeFi backtesting framework. Its broker/market model unifies Superchain networks, enabling cross-chain strategy testing without data silos. Demeter enhances Superchain interop by streamlining DeFi strategy testing across L2/L3 chains like OP Mainnet and Base. Its Backtrader-inspired design simplifies onboarding for developers, while the broker/market model unifies markets (e.g., Uniswap V3 for swaps, Aave V3 for lending) to simulate cross-chain strategies. \n\nDemeter is also a long-term maintained project, operational for over three years with more than ten iterative version updates. This sustained development ensures its reliability, robustness, and adaptability to the evolving DeFi landscape, making it a trusted tool for developers building on Superchain and other EVM-compatible chains.\n\n\n\n## 2. Market Analysis\n\nIn the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape on Superchain, where protocols like Uniswap V3 and Aave V3 drive billions in TVL, onchain application development demands rigorous pre-deployment validation to mitigate risks and maximize efficiency. For DeFi investors and builders, testing strategy viability before real-world execution is paramount: it prevents costly Gas fees from flawed trades, quantifies returns under volatile conditions, and provides empirical evidence to secure team buy-in or funding for dApp launches.\n\nDemeter addresses this critical gap by delivering high-accuracy, real-market simulations. Unlike fragmented testing environments or simplistic spreadsheets, Demeter's contract-derived calculations and multi-market support enable builders to evaluate complex interop scenarios‚Äîsuch as cross-chain yield farming across OP Mainnet and Base‚Äîintuitively and scalably. This not only accelerates dApp prototyping but also democratizes access for non-blockchain natives, aligning with Superchain's ethos of inclusive innovation.\n\n## 3. Adoption of Dev Tool by Onchain Builders\n\nDemeter has already demonstrated strong adoption among onchain builders, evidenced by its integration into high-profile DeFi research and production workflows. Notably, Chaos Labs‚Äîa leading DeFi analytics firm‚Äîleveraged Demeter in their Uniswap Foundation-funded simulation platform for Uniswap V3 liquidity provision. In their case study, Chaos Labs highlights Demeter's role in reproducible, interpretable simulations of actions like add/remove liquidity, swaps, and earnings/loss computations. They state: \n\n> \"In receipt of the grant from Uniswap Foundation, it was deemed crucial for Chaos Labs to conduct simulations using open-source libraries, fostering reproducibility and interpretability of the results. In alignment with this goal, we leveraged the Demeter V3 Python package... Throughout the development process, several challenges were encountered with the package, resulting in contributions that have since been incorporated. We extend our gratitude to the Demeter team for the creation and open-sourcing of this valuable library to the wider Uniswap community.\"  \n> [https://chaoslabs.xyz/resources/chaos_uniswap_v3_lp_simulation_platform_case_study.pdf](https://chaoslabs.xyz/resources/chaos_uniswap_v3_lp_simulation_platform_case_study.pdf)\n\nThis endorsement underscores Demeter's real-world impact.\n"

Shutterized OP Stack L2s bring a host of benefits, including: \n\n\n- Enhanced trading safety and profitability by mitigating front-running. \n- Added (real-time) censorship resistance. \n- Reduced trust assumptions in sequencers through transaction encryption. \n- Potential compliance and regulatory benefits by limiting the sequencer's ability to manipulate transactions.\n\nAdditionally, we have created the SHOP SDK (Shutterized Optimism SDK), a custom ethersjs provider, that allows to send shutter encrypted (\"shutterized\") transactions on Shutter-Optimism. The goal of the SHOP SDK is to make it as easy as possible to transform a traditional application that could run on Optimism into an MEV-protected version running on Shutter-Optimism."

    "description": "Giveth is an open-source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that supports and verifies public goods projects, enabling them to raise crypto with zero added fees and no intermediaries. Today, Giveth supports donations on OP Mainnet, Ethereum Mainnet, Base, Celo, as well as 7 other chains, and several OP Governance projects, such as growthepie, DAOstar, Pairwise, Praise & EAS raise funds on our platform.\n\nRecently, in coordination with the Optimism Token House, we launched DeVouch, a system for members of reputable organizations in the Ethereum ecosystem to vouch for projects looking to raise funding. It was created with special attention to the Optimism Retro Funding mechanism.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nBy vouching for a project, the organization can lend its credibility to the project, building confidence for those looking to support it with funding.\n\nDeVouch collects projects from Gitcoin, Giveth, and Optimism Retro Funding rounds and showcases them in a single place, allowing all users to either vouch for or flag each project. Visitors to the website can see the vouches and flags received by each project, which were tracked by the \"Attester Group\" that the vouch or flag came from. \n\nAttester Groups are formed by looking at on-chain Attestation Data from EAS on Optimism to know who belongs to which organization or community sub-set by which Attestations have been issued to them and by whom. An example of Attester Groups are RetroFunding 5 voters or Gitcoin passport holders.\n\nThis allows members of these groups to lend their reputation to the project looking for funding. However, attesting with DeVouch is a double-edged sword, if a project seems suspicious or untrustworthy then they could also receive a flag, warning others to think twice before supporting this project.\n\nDeVouch is open-source and allows any platform or individual to query DeVouch data using our graphQL API as well as contribute by the issuance of attestations using the DeVouch schema. Anyone can also add their Attester Group to DeVouch by making a simple PR on the DeVouch Github Repository\n\nWho uses it?\n\nDeVouch was launched in early June 2024, and has been featured as additional tooling in Retro Funding 5. Giveth is also integrating it to provide Decentralized Verification of projects seeking funding on the platform.\n\nConsidering that we launched on June 12th of this year, the over 700 onchain attestations that‚Äôve happened through DeVouch before September 18th shows that there are good expectations, regarding the growth of users.\n\nAlso, to map potential, we look at the demand for such a service, and specifically with Optimism, we have over 591 projects (according to Alchemy) between dApps, dexes, etc., which are all looking to take fundraising opportunities and a piece of the $3.3B in Public Goods funding that was set aside by the Optimism Collective. \n\nA decentralized vouching system is essential to bringing more efficiency to allocating funds, as well as to map the reputation of each project by the entire Optimism Community. Is a project a scam? Flag it! Is a project legit? Vouch for it!\n\nGiveth is known for its ability to support projects in their fundraising effort, and yes from October 2023 until September 18th 2024 we facilitated nearly $1M of donations to projects on our platform, and rewarded donors via our GIVbacks program. But our efforts to verify projects are legitimate is often forgotten. With DeVouch, we are decentralizing this effort and enabling other programs, especially in the Superchain, to also verify that the projects applying for funding are legitimate."

    "description": "Djooky is a global, inclusive, decentralized market ecosystem that leverages advanced technologies like AI and Web3.0 for investment attraction and management in the music business. The Djooky ecosystem includes a marketplace for intellectual property rights in music, where musicians can issue shares in the royalty rights of their songs, and their fans and music rights investors can purchase these shares, earn passive income from the song's monetization, and sell these shares on Djooky's secondary market at any time. The entire process of issuing, buying, and selling royalty rights, and the distribution of royalties among artists and investors, is fully automated and approved by the German financial regulator BaFin.\n\nMission: Djooky aims to democratize the music industry by creating a transparent and accessible market for intellectual property rights in music. Through innovative tokenization of music rights and the implementation of advanced features based on artificial intelligence and Web3.0, Djooky introduces a new business model for the music industry.\n\nHow Djooky Works:\n\n1. Music Upload and Originality Check:\n   - Music creators and labels upload their songs to [www.djookyx.com](http://www.djookyx.com).\n   - An AI-based originality check ensures the uniqueness of the song.\n\n2. Royalty Rights Auction:\n   - Rights holders issue shares in the royalty rights of their songs and initiate an auction.\n   - Users must undergo KYC (Know Your Customer) verification to participate in the auction.\n   - Investors place bids on royalty rights shares through a Dutch auction system.\n   - When placing a bid, the investor signs an agreement with the rights holder.\n   - If the bid is successful, the investor receives a contract that designates them as the owner of the royalty rights.\n\n3. Funding and Fund Distribution:\n   - Auction initiators specify the intended use of funds before the auction begins.\n   - Funds raised from the auction are deposited into an escrow account and distributed according to the specified purposes.\n\n4. Royalty Distribution:\n   - Revenues generated by the song are deposited into the escrow account.\n   - These revenues are distributed among the rights holders and investors.\n\n5. Secondary Market:\n   - Djooky has a secondary market where investors can buy and sell shares.\n\nAll processes, including KYC verification, issuing, buying, and selling of royalty rights, and royalty distribution between artists and investors, are automated and approved by the German financial regulator BaFin.\n\nVision: Djooky envisions global opportunities in changing the highly centralized structure of the music industry. The platform develops unique features supported by the latest technologies, ensuring a fair, transparent, and sustainable ecosystem. Djooky establishes a direct connection between artists and their audiences. This vision extends beyond the music industry, with plans to scale the model to other creative industries, including film and video games. \n\nMore details on the Djooky concept can be found in an article by The Wired magazine, a leading global media outlet covering technological developments:  \n[Wired Magazine Article](https://www.wired.com/story/ukraine-startups-resilience-tech-sector/)\n\nDjooky holds exclusive intellectual property rights for the platforms:  \n- [Djookyx](https://djookyx.com/)  \n- [Djooky Awards](https://djookyawards.com/)  \n- [Uk Music](https://ukrmusic.com/)  \n\nThese rights are confirmed by WIPO certificates for trademarks.\n\n- Unique Business Model: Reviewed by leading intellectual property lawyers (Allen & Overy) and approved by the German financial regulator BaFin.\n- Unique Gamification Algorithm \"HitHunter\": Engages users.\n- WIPO Registration Certificates: For Djooky and HitHunter trademarks.\n\nBrand Awareness and Publications: Extensive coverage in global media with over 1,000 publications, including leading outlets like Wired, Billboard, Rolling Stone, and MusicWeek, which have established a strong foundation of trust in the industry:\n\n- [Joint Document with Publications](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16C7XpUpkBoS-A54y_QmMMzuYtrx5LyIi/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=102469239349708522340&rtpof=true&sd=true)"

At AYOWECCA UGANDA, we train rural farmers on regenerative agricultural methods/smart agriculture that are environmentally sustainable, map agricultural practices in carbon credits, promote agroforestry and permaculture where farmers can plant fruit trees besides growing food or cash crops and learn how to make organic manure and pesticides.\n\nWe also have a charity which works in our local communities to mobilize climate change awareness and education, crypto education, tree planting and wetlands and peatland restoration campaigns, workshops, storytelling, giving seeds to farmers, etc.\nIntroducing crypto/Web3 technology to our project adds significant value by revolutionizing\n\nthe way we incentivize and empower farmers and women saving groups. By rewarding\n\nfarmers who save $20 on their crypto wallets and those practicing regenerative agriculture\n\nwith organic manure, we create a direct financial incentive for sustainable practices. This not\n\nonly encourages environmentally friendly farming techniques but also promotes financial\n\ninclusion and literacy among rural communities.\n\nBlockchain technology is essential for ensuring transparency, security, and immutability in\n\nthese reward systems. Through blockchain, we can track and verify transactions securely,\n\nguaranteeing that rewards are distributed fairly and efficiently. The decentralized nature of\n\nblockchain also eliminates the need for intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing trust\n\namong participants.\n\nA traditional or Web2 solution would fall short in providing the same level of transparency,\n\nsecurity, and efficiency that blockchain offers. Without blockchain technology, tracking\n\nrewards and ensuring their proper distribution could be prone to errors, delays, or even\n\nmanipulation. Additionally, the decentralized nature of Web3 allows for greater autonomy and\n\ncontrol over financial transactions compared to traditional centralized systems.\n\nBy leveraging crypto/Web3 technology and blockchain in our project, we not only enhance the\n\neffectiveness of our reward mechanisms but also pave the way for a more inclusive and secure\n\nfinancial ecosystem for rural communities. This innovative approach goes beyond\n\nconventional methods by combining sustainability incentives with digital financial\n\nempowerment, ultimately creating a more resilient foundation for agricultural development\n\nand economic growth in rural areas."

I aspire to be a bridge between Web2 and Web3, and I am studying Web3. On Warpcast, I have launched a diet channel where I invite my real-life friends into the Web3 world and create daily content on the theme of dieting.\n\nThis \"Enjoy 0kcal\" concept is meant to be a meme. Normally, people might think of healthy salads or running when they hear about dieting, but on this diet channel, the opposite is happening. There are many photos of high-calorie foods like hamburgers, ramen, chicken, potatoes, and sweets. By uploading these photos, we playfully suggest, \"Let's pretend the calories we ate don't count! = 0kcal.\"\n\nEating is an activity that happens 365 days a year regardless of age, making it a theme that anyone can participate in and promising a broad reach.

Our library offers zero-configuration testing for deployed contracts via Foundry fork testing, plus simple integration for pre-deployment source code validation. With three testing tiers: Standard (EIP compliance), Security (vulnerability detection), and Features (implementation validation), developers can ship token contracts with confidence, knowing they've been thoroughly vetted against real-world attack vectors and edge cases.\nWhat makes ERCx particularly valuable for the Optimism ecosystem is its cross-chain compatibility and handling of complex deployment scenarios. The library seamlessly works across OP Stack chains and handles storage complexities that often challenge developers working with established tokens like USDC or stETH. By providing this critical testing infrastructure as open-source tooling, we're enabling safer, more reliable token implementations across the entire Superchain, directly supporting the ecosystem's growth while reducing the security risks that have historically plagued token contracts in DeFi."

It is 100% open-source, with all levels contributed by players.\n\nIn 2024, we have continued expanding the game, adding four new advanced levels‚ÄîHigherOrder, Stake, Impersonator, and Magic Animal Carousel‚Äîwhich explore current vulnerabilities in smart contract development. These levels introduce challenges related to low-level EVM programming, staking vulnerabilities, signature verification exploits, and bitwise manipulation attacks, pushing players to deepen their understanding of Ethereum security.\n\nBeyond new levels, we have also redesigned the UI, added support for multiple networks, and expanded language translations to make the game more accessible to a global audience.\n\nWe believe that The Ethernaut is an essential training tool for developers across the Ethereum ecosystem, including those building on the Optimism network. By continually evolving the game with new challenges and features, we strive to make smart contract security education engaging, practical, and accessible to everyone."

    "description": "The Fault Dispute Game Audit Contest was run from July 15-29th to secure the Superchain by looking for bugs in the Fault Dispute Game contracts.\n\nAfter learning that the OP Labs Audit Framework led to a decision to not fund an audit for the Fault Dispute Game (because the safeguards around it were carefully audited), this project was initiated to bring the top security talent in the space together to secure this crucial piece of infrastructure.\n\nThe result was a two week contest featuring legends like samczsun (the GOAT of whitehats), cts (founder of Zellic), Riley Holterhus (Spearbit Lead Security Researcher), pwning.eth (3rd place on Immunefi all time leaderboard), xuwinnie (winner of the largest audit contest pot of all time), as well as 1000+ other researchers.\n\nThis format proved very effective. The contest uncovered 5 High severity vulnerabilities, as well as 11 Medium severity issues and numerous smaller improvements. These findings spurred the Granite network upgrade (https://gov.optimism.io/t/upgrade-proposal-10-granite-network-upgrade/8733).\n\nMy role was to bring the full audit from idea to completion with the best possible results and minimal time commitment from the OP Labs team. This included:\n- Identifying that this was an important issue for Superchain security, writing the Mission Request, applying, and securing the funding to run the contest.\n- Determining the optimal format to use the funds to find bugs. After discussing an on chain CTF format, decided with OP Labs team that a contest (with some added features) would work best.\n- Negotiating with contest platforms to get the most appealing deal. In the end, Code4rena hosted the contest at zero fee (their typical fee would be 60k OP on a contest of this size).\n- Recruiting top auditors to focus their full time attention on this contest. Selected folks specifically who had the relevant skills for the codebase and worked with them to put together a deal.\n- Took the role of OP Labs representative in organizing the contest: writing scoping documents, organizing the contest repo, putting together ideas to focus researcher attention on the right areas of the codebase, hosting a livestream to walk through the codebase at kickoff, etc.\n- Answering all participant questions during the contest to ensure every valid idea was fully explored.\n- Judging the contest, reviewing all submissions, deduplicating issues, assessing the validity (with the support of OP Labs on final decisions), and putting together the final issues list for the OP Labs team to fix."

    "description": "Optimism initially launched with single-shot fraud proofs (now called fault proofs).  I audited the architecture and implementation, and performed extensive research on risks associated with fraud proofs.  In the course of this research I found many vulnerabilities and implemented PoC exploits to demonstrate them.  Optimism did not have a bounty program at the time of this audit so I submitted the results without asking for compensation.\n\nAfter coordinating the disclosure with the OP team, I disclosed my research, Optimistic Time Travel: https://medium.com/infinitism/optimistic-time-travel-6680567f1864\n\nThe results led to the conclusion that single shot fraud proofs are unsafe and should be replaced with interactive fraud proofs.  The vulnerable implementation was disabled.  The architecture was redesigned and interactive fault proofs were introduced in an upgrade earlier this year: https://gov.optimism.io/t/final-protocol-upgrade-7-fault-proofs/8161/1\n\nWhile the research was published in 2022, its impact happened in 2024 when optimism upgraded to the new and safer fault proofs architecture.  Hence I'm submitting this security research in the OP stack research category \"Security audits specifically on the OP Stack or its components\"."

Flexy currently charges a minimal 0.1% fee for non-stablecoin transfers to offset operational costs (liquidity provisioning), though we aim to offer fully-free transfers for all tokens, subsidized by retrofunding.\n\nUtilizing EIP-2612, users need only sign a single off-chain signature to initiate a bridge transaction, reducing user friction and abstracting away crypto complexities. All values are denominated in USD to make value transfer clear and easy to understand.\n\nFlexy can be integrated into any dApp via the Flexy widget, installable via npm.

In this study, we compare different types of programs such as Uniswap, dYdX, Optimism, and Gitcoin, categorizing them into \"top-down,\" \"bottom-up,\" and \"QF (algorithmic)\" types.

We aim to uncover the differences among various grant programs and provide insights that could improve future program management. By conducting a cross-comparative quantitative analysis, focusing especially on decision-making bodies, we investigated how grant amounts and the number of grants are influenced by different types of decision-making mechanisms. Looking ahead, we plan to develop tools for impact evaluation, impact measurement, or outcome measurement based on these results. This will enable evidence-based public goods funding by using grants data, ensuring that future grants are more effective and aligned with measurable outcomes.\n\nThis research and development includes Optimism Collective as a subject of investigation, focusing on identifying the unique characteristics of the Optimism Collective, analyzing the current state of its fund distribution, and comparing it with other grant programs.

    "description": "fxhash is an open generative art platform and marketplace for creating and collecting art made with code. In housing the world's largest collection of generative art projects, fxhash offers unparalleled technology and tooling for artistic onchain communities everywhere.\n\nAfter releasing our beta on Tezos in 2021, we became the world's first crosschain generative art platform with our Ethereum integration 2 years later. Now, we're excited to continue our journey, trying to tackle some of the inherent economic issues we have seen within the NFT landscape. \n\nOver the past few years, the NFT art market has seen meteoric rises and troubling declines, leaving many to question the sustainability of current models. Collectors are disengaging, liquidity is increasingly concentrated in the hands of a few, and the broader ecosystem of artists struggles to thrive.\n\nAs a platform dedicated to empowering generative artists, fxhash has not only witnessed this decline but also felt a responsibility to address it. We recognize that artists are much more than the sum of their individual projects; they are innovators, storytellers, and creators of culture whose impact transcends individual releases.\n\nAt fxhash we not only want to provide the tools to enable these creative visions, but also provide artists with a stable eco-system in which they can take creative risks.\n\nIntroducing the $FXH protocol: an artist-first protocol designed to empower creators by tokenizing their brands, and provide collectors with a new way to engage with the eco-system. The implementation of this vision will take shape through the $FXH ‚Üî $ARTIST token launchpad, through which artists can seamlessly create and launch their own tokens, all coupled with artistic projects.\n\nWe hope that this lays the foundations for a new community-owned, onchain art economy.

    "description": "Giveth is an open-source, radically transparent, user-friendly donation platform that supports verified public goods projects to raise crypto with zero added fees and no intermediaries. We build and advance novel fundraising mechanisms like quadratic funding, donor rewards, and decentralized project curation.\n\nToday, Giveth supports donations on eleven chains and networks, including Optimism, Ethereum Mainnet, Celo, and Base.  \n\nGiveth has been live on Optimism since 2023, enabling projects to accept Optimism donations (over $570,000 USD raised on OP Mainnet as of March 2025). Through our GIVbacks program, we have rewarded donors to verified projects with over 18.1 million OP Mainnet GIV to date. As of March 2025, over 101 million $GIV is staked in our contracts on OP Mainet, increasing Optimism TVL. There are a total of 1887 GIV holders on Optimism, where 48% of the GIV circulating supply exists.\n\nAs an onboarding effort to bring high-trust community members to Optimism, we have been offering 25 OP tokens to each project on Giveth that passes our verification system requirements and adds an Optimism recipient address. We have onboarded and rewarded 4,794 projects through this program thus far. \n\nTo enhance these onboarding efforts, we have been running quadratic funding (QF) rounds that require verified projects to add an Optimism address, with the matching pools on Optimism, specifically, totaling more than 163,000 USD.\n\nHow it works\n\nGiveth goes beyond ‚Äújust donations‚Äù with the following features:\n\n* GIVbacks - Donors who give to verified public goods projects have a chance to win up to 500,000 GIV. This fun means of rewarding donors is a decentralized and borderless way of incentivizing donations.\n\n* GIVpower - Donors can lock their GIV tokens for GIVpower and use them to boost/curate projects on the platform. Projects with more GIVpower give their donors greater chances of winning the GIVbacks raffles. Top-boosted projects also appear higher on Giveth!\n\n* Quadratic Funding (QF) - The democratic matching program popularized by Gitcoin is also available on Giveth! Projects and donors enjoy multi-chain donation rounds with an easy and streamlined user experience.\n\n* Quadratic Acceleration (q/acc) - A novel funding mechanism combining Quadratic Funding with Augmented Bonding Curves, allowing projects to launch tokens with built-in liquidity. Supporters receive tokens for their contributions, quadratic matching builds secondary market liquidity, and projects gain a sustainable revenue stream, earning a % of every token mint or burn.\n\n* Devouch - A decentralized vouching mechanism that lets people mint attestations and lend their reputation to projects they support for a variety of applications. Giveth uses on-chain attestations made on Optimism in our decentralized project verification system. Using Devouch, the ‚ÄúGiveth Verifiers‚Äù attestor group (which includes members of Optimism, Metacartel, ENS, Octant and more) can mint on-chain attestations for Giveth projects. Projects with three attestations from verifiers get labeled ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù on the Giveth platform and gain access to benefits like GIVpower and specific QF rounds. \n\n* Cause-Focused AI Agent DAO - an initiative leveraging AI-driven governance to bring funding to public goods. Cause-focused agents backed by tokens on a bonding curve will collect token holder input and allocate funds accordingly to public goods projects within their cause.\n\nWho uses Giveth\n\nCurrently, 6,300+ projects have raised over $4.1M from 135,000+ donations from 21,000+ unique donor addresses on Giveth.\n\nTo understand how deep our connection with the Optimism ecosystem really is, if we consider only Superchain numbers, we have 4,785 projects, 5,597 donors, and donations that have totaled over $570,000. Devouch has driven 1936 on-chain attestations on Optimism from over 580 unique attestors.\n\nGiveth is onboarding real-world impact projects to web3 by empowering them with free access to novel fundraising mechanisms and new donors ecosystems, while inspiring them to dive deeper into the blockchain rabbit hole.\n\nIn the last 180 days, we have made huge progress, running three quadratic funding rounds with the following results:\n\nMatching Pools (on the Superchain): $205,000 USD equivalent\n\nAdditional crowdfunded donations so far (one round is ongoing and ends April 2, 2025): $90,285 USD equivalent\n\nProjects: 334 (some projects took part in more than one round)\n\nDonors so far: 1719  (some donors took part in more than one round)\n\nENS x Octant Public Goods (March 18, 2025 ‚Äì April 2, 2025)\nhttps://giveth.notion.site/ENS-x-Octant-Public-Goods-Round-Overview-1983ab28d48c80fd92d3fe688128e189?pvs=74 \n\nLoving on Public Goods Results & Wrap-up (January 28 ‚Äì February 15, 2025) https://forum.giveth.io/t/loving-on-public-goods-qf-round-results-wrap-up-january-28-february-14-2025/1975/1\n\nGIV-a-Palooza Round Results & Wrap-up (September 10 ‚Äì 24, 2024) https://forum.giveth.io/t/giv-a-palooza-round-results-wrap-up-september-10-24-2024\n\nWe have also launched loads of features including a custom donation widget, a project curation program, and streaming donations.

    "description": "Golden Otter (GOTR) is a community-driven memecoin, gaming initiative and DeFi mini-app built on WorldChain (part of the Superchain ecosystem) under the PUF framework. Our diverse, multilingual team chose WorldChain for its feeless transactions, ensuring that anyone‚Äîregardless of their financial background‚Äîcan join, play, stake and earn. Golden Otter launched as an ERC-20 token traded from day one, thanks to token purchases by creators (no free airdrops), which instills intrinsic value and drives long-term liquidity and market-cap growth.\n\nAt the heart of the ecosystem is the Golden Otter Maze Game: users earn 1‚Äì50 GOTR daily from a 1.5 million-token pool, halving to 1‚Äì25 GOTR after that, then to 1‚Äì12 GOTR after another million, and finally to 1‚Äì5 GOTR after 500 000. Once this is depleted, an expandable pool of 250 000 GOTR kicks in, and upon its exhaustion, rewards shift permanently to Baby Otter. Alongside play-to-earn, we‚Äôll offer interactive lessons on blockchain fundamentals, DeFi and digital-asset management.\n\nGolden Otter Hub‚Äîa mini-app embedded in the World App wallet‚Äîintroduces smart-contract staking for GOTR with a dynamic APY model paid exclusively in Baby Otter. Zero initial Baby Otter supply mints only via staking, with APYs tiered from 15 % up to 100 %, linearly tapering over five years to balance early incentives with sustainable TVL growth. Nearly 1 810 479 Baby Otter have already been distributed through staking alone, underscoring strong product-market fit and vibrant community participation.\n\nBy combining tokenomics, gaming, education and intuitive staking, Golden Otter fosters robust on-chain liquidity‚Äîinitially bootstrapped via PUF and easily migratable to DEXs‚Äîand seamless ERC-20 interoperability. Future roadmap items include additional mini-apps within the World App wallet, further enriching cross-chain engagement and reinforcing Golden Otter as a truly global, accessible Web3 ecosystem."

    "description": "Golden Otter Hub is a mini app integrated within the World App wallet that utilizes smart contracts for staking, explicitly designed for the World Chain blockchain. It enhances Superchain adoption through intuitive staking mechanisms and engaging tokenomics. Built around the ERC-20 Golden Otter (GOTR) token, Golden Otter Hub provides users with a compelling reason to participate in World Chain‚Äôs expanding ecosystem.\n\nThe project‚Äôs core innovation lies in its dynamic APY staking model, offering attractive yet sustainable staking rewards paid exclusively in Baby Otter tokens. The Baby Otter token was initially created with zero supply, and new tokens are generated exclusively through the staking process. With clearly defined APY tiers ranging from an initial 15% up to 100%, the system incentivizes both small and large holders to stake their GOTR tokens. Over time, APY rewards are linearly reduced across a five-year span, carefully balancing short-term engagement with long-term value appreciation, resulting in stable and growing Total Value Locked (TVL).\n\nGolden Otter Hub significantly boosts high-quality onchain value by directly contributing to liquidity and increasing token demand. The staking application naturally promotes sustained liquidity pools, initially established via the PUF application, which transition smoothly to decentralized exchanges (DEX). As a result, Golden Otter Hub ensures robust liquidity support and transparent trading, benefiting both token holders and the broader World Chain ecosystem.\n\nInteroperability is another cornerstone of the Golden Otter Hub strategy. By harnessing World Chain‚Äôs ERC-20 compatibility, Golden Otter tokens are seamlessly tradable across various decentralized exchanges, creating pathways for further ecosystem integration. Future developments within the Golden Otter ecosystem include additional mini apps integrated directly within the World App wallet, further amplifying cross-chain engagement and interoperability.\n\nTo date, nearly 70,000 Baby Otter tokens have already been distributed, exclusively via staking‚Äîdemonstrating clear product-market fit and vibrant community engagement. Golden Otter Hub not only enriches World Chain's ecosystem but actively drives user adoption, fostering a vibrant, interconnected, and economically thriving blockchain community."

Our team of 4 experts in social choice theory, modeling and simulations, and token engineering (Nimrod Talmon, PhD, Angela Kreitenweis, Eyal Briman, and Muhammad Idrees) has now gone beyond the Mission Request‚Äôs scope to analyze actual Optimism Retro Funding voting designs and improve governance performance by proposing new, strategyproof voting rules.\n\n**Deliverables by September 18:**\n\n- Voting Design Mathematical Specification:\nDeriving the formal specification of the exact voting rules applied in Optimism‚Äôs Retro Funding Rounds 1‚Äì4 (R1‚Äì4) to allow for rigorous, axiomatic analysis\n\n- Voting Design Evaluation Framework:\nDeriving a 360¬∞ evaluation framework based on Optimism Retro Funding objectives\n\n- Voting Design Evaluation Metrics:\nDeveloping metrics to rigorously verify voting designs against Retro Funding objectives, applying theoretical, axiomatic analysis and agent-based simulations \n\n- Testing and Verification of Optimism‚Äôs R1‚Äì4 Voting Rules:\nVerifying if the R1‚Äì4 voting rules satisfy Incentive Compatibility so that voters can not improve their results by lying about their preferences (known as ‚Äústrategyproofness‚Äù in social choice theory)\n\n- Detection of Major Flaws in Optimism Retro Funding:\nWe found major flaws in the Optimism Retro Funding voting designs (none of the R1‚Äì4 voting designs satisfy strategyproofness!)\n\n- Provided two Strategyproof Solutions:\nGovXS proposed two alternative voting designs to solve strategyproofness and meet Optimism Retro Funding‚Äôs design goals \n\n** Links:** \n1) Making Optimism Retro Funding Strategyproof (Report) ‚Äì https://mirror.xyz/0x803860D2C333734cD99625d8d189d0Eb2e565166/gvjQpafjVxAeeQnb7_Oc--5Oc7chV55zwR_NCa1_9KU\n\n2) A Social Choice Analysis of Retroactive Funding (PDF) ‚Äì https://github.com/GovXS/Evaluating-Voting-Design-Tradeoffs-for-Retro-Funding/blob/main/A%20Social%20Choice%20Analysis%20of%20Retroactive%20Funding.pdf\n\n3) GovXS Retro Funding Simulator (Open-source) ‚Äì¬†https://github.com/GovXS/Evaluating-Voting-Design-Tradeoffs-for-Retro-Funding\n\n\n**Positive impact:**\n\n- Securing Truthful Voting:\nUsing strategyproof voting designs ensures that voters can achieve their best results only by voting according to their true preferences. Current Retro Funding voting designs are not strategyproof. We propose alternative voting designs to solve this issue.\n\n- Securing Expert/Guest Voter Experiments:\nOptimism Retro Funding is running experiments with badgeholders, guest voters, and expert voters, investing sizably to gain insights on how to best select the most knowledgeable, value-aligned voters. These insights rely on learnings from analyzing voting data and voter preferences. If this data is skewed due to voting designs not being strategyproof, wrong conclusions will be drawn, creating negative impacts e.g. on future rounds‚Äô scope and size, or voter and project participation, hurting the entire ecosystem.\n\n- Securing ‚ÄúImpact = Profit‚Äù:\nOptimism's vision is to build a global system where positive impact to the collective is rewarded by profit to the individual, so that ‚ÄúImpact = Profit‚Äù. Retro Funding aims to find the ground truth in funding allocation. There is no instrument or algorithm yet to measure a project‚Äôs positive impact and the respective profit it deserves. That‚Äôs why you, as a voter, are asked to assess project applications by voting in Retro Funding. If the voting rule provides voters with the wrong incentives, the results will be distorted, and Optimism Retro Funding cannot get any closer to reaching a fair, objective truth supporting ‚ÄúImpact = Profit‚Äù."

    "description": "Gyroscope is a decentralized protocol providing stablecoin and liquidity infrastructure. Gyroscope includes two main products: an all-weather meta-stablecoin that tokenizes stablecoin risk control and more efficient liquidity pools based on asymmetric concentrated liquidity. Gyroscope's liquidity pools are ideal for key markets including stablecoins, LSTs, and LRTs.\n\nGyroscope has been live on Optimism since July 2023 and has become one of the dominant liquidity sources for wstETH on Optimism with over 258m of volume. With the launch of Gyroscope‚Äôs stablecoin GYD on Ethereum in December, the project is well placed to further expand on Optimism now.\n\nGyro Dollars (GYD): a decentralized stablecoin focused on risk control\n\nGYD is fully backed by a basket of assets with pioneering innovations in risk control built in at the protocol level. GYD aims to segment and contain risks from across the asset space with:\n\nAutomated risk diversification rules\n\nOptimized minting and redemption bonding curves that guide the protocol on how to use reserve assets to maintain stability\n\nA new resilient oracle and circuit breaker system that handles stress.\n\nGYD is built from first principles on rigorous understanding of DeFi risk. It serves as a principled and non-custodial risk control layer for stablecoin holders and aims to be the safest on-chain stable asset.\n\nE-CLPs: highly efficient and customizable AMMs\n\nGyroscope E-CLPs, standing for elliptic concentrated liquidity pools, are a novel liquidity pool type that enables asymmetric concentration of liquidity. E-CLPs focalize trading of assets along the curve of an ellipse. E-CLPs have several advantages over other liquidity pool types:\n\nE-CLPs are up to 75% more capital efficient than Stableswap liquidity pools.\n\nE-CLPs are highly customizable. They allow a further degree of flexibility as liquidity no longer needs to be spread evenly within uniform price bounds.\n\nE-CLPs don‚Äôt require active position management and adapt automatically to yield-accruing assets. The pool deployer takes on responsibility of calibrating and establishing trading parameters upon launch.\n\nE-CLPs package concentrated liquidity into a customizable and passive form that is also easily composable as collateral in other protocols.\n\nRehype E-CLPs: even more efficient E-CLPs that reduce the cost of capital for stablecoin liquidity We just launched an extension of E-CLPs that combine the E-CLP's asymmetric concentrated liquidity with auto-rehypothecation of pool assets to Aave. This launch included a first Rehype pool on Optimism. Rehype pools allow LPs to combine multiple yield sources together to further increase capital efficiency. In Rehype pools, LPs simultaneously earn swap fees, lending yields, and token incentives from Balancer gauges while remaining in direct control (contrary to common rehypothecation in TradFi). This makes pools more profitable and lowers the cost of capital required for stablecoin pools in particular. This also allows pool incentives to stretch further as they don‚Äôt need to match Aave yields and only need to provide a small bump on top.\n\n\nRehype pools are a more efficient and safer form of Balancer‚Äôs boosted pools, which previously reached 300m TVL, including 12m on Optimism. Rehype pools work with a simple, modular design that is aimed to minimize smart contract risk and doesn‚Äôt introduce new smart contract code for the rehypothecation. They instead handle complexity at the more flexible layers of SOR and front end design. They are thus comparatively safer than alternative pool designs as the Rehype pools inherit the safety record of the E-CLPs and only add in Aave risks.\n\nMetrics of Gyroscope:\n\nTotal TVL: 33m USD (4.25m on Optimism)\n\nTotal volume: 1.27b USD (258m on Optimism)\n\nGYD supply: 5.4m USD\n\nMonthly active users: 10k (includes GYD users, LPs, and traders)\n\nOver 2300 LP addresses across current E-CLPs on Ethereum, Optimism, and Polygon\n\n13k+ Discord users\n\n3k provably unique early community members\n\n15+ highly involved community members (non-team) who are bootstrapping initial governance delegation and dao-to-dao bd initiatives\n\nDune dashboards: https://dune.com/gyro_finance/gyroscope\n\nThis grant would be for the initial development entity of the Gyroscope protocol, FTL Labs."

That's right you can send coins directly to your friends using the social feed and emojis.

People receive a daily allocation of Ham based on their community points.\n\nThe Ham ecosystem is backed by a memecoin on Base called $TN100x. Part of Ham, I launched an NFT project called The Based LP. Each Based LP is backed by a certain amount of $TN100x. The NFT can be burnt to redeem the $TN100x - 60% of the backing is redeemed immediately while the remaining 40% goes to backing the remaining NFTs.\n\nWe also recently launched $PHAM - an index style asset backed by 6 Base memecoins. Through owning a single token you get exposure to all 6. \n\nLastly we are launching Ham chain next week. Its an L3 built using the OP stack. "

    "description": "HandsNFT AI is a game where strategy, on-chain randomness, and blockchain innovation come together in a competitive, reward-driven ecosystem. Your journey begins by minting Hand Cards, progressing through levels, and claiming rewards as you aim for the prestigious Diamondhand status.\n\nHandsNFT AI is designed to be fully decentralized, with every development built around the principle of trustless, on-chain mechanics. Unlike traditional blockchain games, this game is not tokenized‚Äîmeaning players don‚Äôt need to stake tokens or make additional investments to participate. Instead, they simply pay a small minting fee to enter the game and compete for real rewards.\n\nIn HandsNFT AI, Hand Cards replace traditional NFTs, serving as your key to earning and leveling up. At the end of each season, players who reach Level 4 (Diamondhand) will be able to migrate their Hand Cards and receive an exclusive Ethereum-based NFT, unlocking special benefits in future seasons.\n\nThe game introduces a claim-based reward system, eliminating staking-unstaking mechanics. Each Hand Card comes with a timer that must complete before players can claim their rewards. After claiming, the Level Up button activates, allowing players to risk an upgrade using on-chain randomness. Success grants access to higher reward pools, while failure resets the timer for another attempt.\n\nThis structure ensures that HandsNFT AI thrives even in the worst market conditions, as rewards are independent of external token fluctuations. Players can continuously compete, level up, and earn without worrying about token volatility.\n\nHandsNFT AI is more than just a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a challenge of patience, risk-taking, and strategic decision-making. Whether you aim to maximize rewards or reach the elite Diamondhand status, the game delivers a thrilling, decentralized gaming experience driven by real blockchain incentives.\n\nTeam Information\n\nName: Basar Mahmutluoglu\nTitle: COO\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bmahmutluoglu/\nTwitter: https://x.com/basar_eth\n\nName: Gorkem Yavuz\nTitle: CTO\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/gorkemyavuz/\nTwitter: https://x.com/ygorkem0\n\nName: Ismail Keskin\nTitle: CCO\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ikskn/\nTwitter: https://x.com/cryptoperseus_\n\nBackgrounds:\n\nBasar Mahmutluoglu - Business Development & Operations\nWith six years of Web2 experience and four years in Web3, Basar has built a strong track record in strategic growth and partnerships.

    "description": "Hurupay Overview:\nWhat are we building?\nHurupay is building global USD banking powered by stablecoins‚Äîa seamless way for individuals and businesses worldwide to receive USD payments without needing a traditional US bank account.\n\nWhat is the product?\nHurupay provides stablecoin-based US accounts that come with a unique US account number and routing number, allowing remote workers, freelancers, and businesses to receive USD payments via ACH or Wire, just like a US-based bank account.\n\n\nHow it works:\n1. User gets a US account with an account and routing number in their name.\n2. User shares their account details with a sender (employer, client, or business).\n3. Sender sends USD via ACH, Wire, PayPal, or other financial apps.\n4. User receives USDC instantly in their Hurupay wallet.\n\n\nKey Use Cases\n1. Freelancers & Remote Workers ‚Äì Get paid by US companies, clients, or platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, Payoneer, Wise, and PayPal.\n2. Entrepreneurs & Individuals ‚Äì Receive global USD payments from family, friends, and businesses.\n3. Businesses ‚Äì Accept USD from global clients and pay suppliers in different regions.\n\nTraction:\nWe launched in December 2024, and in just 3 months, we‚Äôve grown seen exponentially\nRevenue growth:\nJanuary: $5,000\nFebruary: $25,610\nMarch (Week 1 alone): $20,000\nTotal transaction volume: $2.2 million+\nUser growth: 5,000 MAUs across Argentina, Nigeria, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and the Philippines.\nBacked by: Founders Inc. and incredible angels (Tiffany Johnson (Managing Director, Microsoft for Startups) and Dawson Botsford (Former CTO, Bankless)\n\nCompetitive Landscape\nTraditional Banks & Western Union:\n1. Require high incomes to open USD accounts.\n2. Charge monthly fees and up to 6% in cross-border fees.\n3. Slow settlements (3-7 days) for international transactions.\n\nPayPal & Wise:\n1. Unavailable in many emerging markets (South America, Africa, Southeast Asia).\n2. Do not support stablecoin transactions, limiting efficiency and speed.\n\nHow We Stand Out & Win:\n1. First-Mover Advantage ‚Äì We are pioneering stablecoin-based US accounts for emerging markets where demand for USD is high but access is very limited.\n2. Instant Setup ‚Äì Users get a fully functional US account in under 5 minutes without leaving their house. \n3. Low-Cost & Transparent ‚Äì Only 2% fees (vs. 6%+ for traditional banks, PayPal, and Wise).\n4. Faster Settlements ‚Äì We support Same-Day ACH, making payments nearly instant.\n5. Self-Custody & Crypto-Friendly ‚Äì Users have full control of their funds while benefiting from stablecoin-powered USD banking.\n6. Seamless Crypto On/Off-Ramp ‚Äì Users can move funds to Binance, Bybit, or P2P markets for the best FX rates.\n7. Super Easy to Use ‚Äì Unlike Metamask or crypto exchanges, we abstract gas fees and private key management for a seamless experience.\n\n\nHow We Make Money\n1. ACH Deposits: 2% + $0.50\n2. Wire Deposits: 2% + $20 (US bank processing fee passed to users)\n\n\nRoadmap:\n1. IBANs for EUR payments.\n2. Virtual cards (Visa/Mastercard) for online shopping/purchases.\n3. Add support for more local banks & mobile money withdrawals.\n4. Staking feature to encourage more deposits for people to earn interest.\n\n\nTeam:\n1. Philip Mburu  (CEO + Growth) - 2nd-time founder, 6 years in crypto.\n2. Allan Okoth  (CTO + Product) - 2nd-time, 7 years in software & crypto.\n3. James Mugambi  (COO + Finance) - 2nd-time, 6 years in Finance."

This group includes individuals working in various teams at the Ethereum Foundation (RIG, Consensus R&D, Cryptography) and Prysmatic labs, as well as academic researchers from Yale University and Duke University.\n\n* What we do \n\nWe work on designing mechanisms to ensure the L1 protocol can maintain chain neutrality [1] by enabling the decentralized set of Ethereum validators to force include transactions in Ethereum blocks. This is achieved via inclusion lists [2, 3, 4], which prevent more centralized and sophisticated parties (e.g., builders) from arbitrarily excluding transactions.‚Ä®‚Ä®In the past year, we explored the design space and made significant progress toward a design called Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL, [5]), which we believe should be considered for inclusion in one of the upcoming Ethereum upgrades. \n\nWe are now in the process of writing an Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) and working on specifications and proof-of-concepts to transition from research to development. In parallel, we are working on improving the mechanism to determine whether similar logic can be extended to guarantee timely blob inclusion or if the identity of participants creating inclusion lists can be protected [6]. ‚Ä®‚Ä®\n\nReferences\n[1] https://ethresear.ch/t/uncrowdable-inclusion-lists-the-tension-between-chain-neutrality-preconfirmations-and-proposer-commitments/19372\n\n[2] https://notes.ethereum.org/@fradamt/forward-inclusion-lists\n\n[3] https://ethresear.ch/t/no-free-lunch-a-new-inclusion-list-design/16389\n\n[4] https://ethresear.ch/t/the-more-the-less-censored-introducing-committee-enforced-inclusion-sets-comis-on-ethereum/18835\n\n[5] https://ethresear.ch/t/fork-choice-enforced-inclusion-lists-focil-a-simple-committee-based-inclusion-list-proposal/19870\n\n[6] https://ethresear.ch/t/anonymous-inclusion-lists-anon-ils/19627/1"

This approach lowers hosting costs, improves data availability, and reduces censorship, laying the groundwork for a more secure and permanent global information network.\n\nIPFS is used in a variety of applications. While some users interact with IPFS via imported libraries in their projects, a large amount of usage comes via IPFS' HTTP Gateway API which allows users to self-host, use extensions like IPFS companion, or publicly run gateways (whether paid ones run by companies like Filebase, Pinata, etc. or the public goods services at ipfs.io and dweb.link).\n\nIPFS is a system for moving data across decentralized networks, with >11M weekly users and 250K public p2p nodes. Highlights:\n\n1. Off-chain storage. IPFS provides verifiable, off-chain storage, often used to reduce on-chain needs in Ethereum & Optimism. Examples: TrueBlocks (local IPFS-based index for EVM chains, built with grants from OP & EF), Snapshot (IPFS-based off-chain voting).\n\n2. Go-to distribution network for fully decentralized third-party app frontends (for gaming, DeFi, & more). We run gateway services that serve 900M requests/wk, and added native IPFS support to browsers like Chromium & Brave.\n\n3. NFT metadata gold standard.

    "description": "Keng Lernitas is a meme project that has been called the ‚Äúbiggest meme on Optimism‚Äù upon its creation. It began as an experiment by Kain Warwick to test the new gas costs after the implementation of EIP-4844. Consequently, a curated degen ecosystem, featuring $2192/$ZORKSEES, was born.\n\nNow, to explain what we do, let‚Äôs explore our brief history. Last March, Kain airdropped $2192 on Optimism to SNX stakers and asked the brand new holders to burn 90% of their tokens to be ‚Äúspared‚Äù from the oubliettes. This initiated the first alignment test. The newly formed team behind the meme project, including Kain and his brother Grant Warwick, recognized the faithful and rewarded them with airdropped $ZORKSEES tokens on Base. For the next challenge, Keng Lernitas and Zorksees were compelled to ‚Äúbatel.‚Äù The team challenged the community to bridge tokens from Solana to Base using Wormhole, and once again, sacrifice tokens by transferring them into a \"batel\" wallet. The side that achieved the highest TVL would win. In total, more than 40% of the combined supply of $2192/$ZORKSEES has already been burned or sent to \"batel\" for the promise of glory (https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192).\n\nIn summary, we are an event-driven meme project striving to create value for our community and allies. The newly established governance, called Keng Lernitas Ekosistem, is asking for a grant to continue building on our gamification culture by hosting more games and events. Throughout our journey, we have made fierce allies from the Synthetix and Infinex communities. Now, it is only natural to seek an alliance with the mighty Optimism Superchain!\n\nSome facts:\n\n-Around $250,000 USD of LP/bribes/incentives on Velodrome/Aerodrome was spent by Kain Warwick for experimental purposes\n-35.5% of $2192 supply has been burned\n-27% of $ZORKSEES supply and 8% of $2192 supply was sent to \"batel\" wallet\n-60k $2192 holders\n-6k $ZORKSEES holders on EVM\n\nSource: https://dune.com/nice2win/lernitas2192 / https://dune.com/nice2win/zorksees"

The idea of dressing the cat in a knight's armor was inspired by the juxtaposition of something fierce and protective with something as adorable and innocent as a cat.

While KEVM offers our verification infrastructure to all EVM-based smart contracts, Kontrol greatly reduces the barrier to entry to formal verification for Solidity smart contracts.\nOur tooling is completely open source and freely accessible to all developers of the Optimism ecosystem at no additional cost.\n\nKEVM is an EVM executable formal semantics written in the K framework. KEVM passes all Ethereum conformance tests and is the entry point for formally verifying smart contracts with the K framework. However, using plain KEVM requires ad-hoc training on the K framework to write specifications. Additionally, these specifications can be quite verbose, increasing the difficulty of writing them.\n\nKontrol solves this by allowing developers to write the formal specification of their smart contracts directly as Foundry property tests. These tests are automatically translated into KEVM specifications, keeping all the verification guarantees whilst allowing for a much more easy developer experience."

Users earn points by engaging in entertaining activities such as solving quizzes, reading news articles, playing mini-games, and exploring daily fortunes. These points can be redeemed for OP tokens, which can then be spent on in-app coupons, creating a seamless and rewarding user experience. While Web2 reward apps thrive in markets like Korea, Japan, North America, Latin America, and Southeast Asia, Kropot introduces a transformative twist by integrating Web3 technology, unlocking new opportunities for users and developers alike.\n\n[Seamless User Onboarding with Web3 Innovation]\n\nKropot leverages Account Abstraction and social login, to eliminate traditional barriers to entry. Users no longer need to manage seed phrases or worry about gas fees‚Äîaccount abstraction enables gas sponsorship, while social login simplifies wallet creation. This creates a frictionless onboarding process for both Web2 and Web3 users. Unlike many Web3 projects that rely on Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), Kropot is a standalone native application available on both iOS and Android. This native approach significantly enhances user experience, driving engagement and fostering mass adoption within the Superchain ecosystem.\n\n[A Proven Business Model with Web3 Potential]\n\nKropot‚Äôs revenue model is built on advertisements, a sustainable and well-established approach in the Web2 space. However, Kropot extends this model by welcoming Web3 companies and services as advertising partners, creating a unique bridge between traditional businesses and the decentralized economy. By offering engaging entertainment and seamless integration with the Superchain, Kropot not only attracts users but also serves as a powerful funnel for Web3 adoption, benefiting the broader Superchain ecosystem.\n\n[Empowering Developers with Kroma ID]\n\nKropot is powered by Kroma ID, an ecosystem wallet SDK that provides developers with tools to tap into Kropot‚Äôs growing user base(public access to the SDK is work in progress). This SDK enables seamless integration of dApps to Kropot, which expands the reach of the Superchain.\n\n[Traction and Onchain Impact]\n\nSince its launch in January 2025, Kropot has achieved remarkable growth, acquiring over 180,000 users in just over two months. The app boasts a strong Week 1 retention rate of 26.3%, demonstrating its ability to engage and retain users. On the OP Mainnet, the Kropot‚Äôs smart contract have generated more than 11,000 transactions across 7,300 unique KYC-ed user addresses. These metrics highlight Kropot‚Äôs contribution to the Optimism ecosystem, driving both user adoption and transaction volume.\n\n[Why Kropot Matters for RetroFunding]\n\nKropot exemplifies the mission of the OP RetroFunding Onchain Builders mission by delivering a user-centric, scalable, and innovative application that bridges Web2 and Web3. Through its seamless onboarding, native app experience, and integration with the Superchain, Kropot drives mass adoption while generating meaningful onchain activity. Its sustainable business model and developer-friendly tools, such as Kroma ID, further amplify its impact, creating a virtuous cycle of growth, engagement, and ecosystem development."

It supports deployment on Docker or Kubernetes, providing extensive access to a wide range of tools. The ethPandaOps team actively maintains a Layer 1 Ethereum blockchain definition through the ethereum-package, which is utilized to validate and test future Ethereum upgrades, facilitating the identification of semi-reproducible bugs.\n\nLeveraging Kurtosis's modular architecture, we have developed an Optimism package that builds on top of the maintained L1 devnet. This allows OP-Chains to develop, test, and verify changes independently, without the need to continuously monitor L1 changes.\n\nThe local deployment capabilities of our package enable rapid feedback cycles during development, while the built-in multi-client support ensures interoperability across different clients. We have collaborated with the op-reth, op-erigon, and op-nethermind node teams to verify and fix bugs using the Optimism package.\n"

Additionally, it was the first time I used Onchain Attestation, and I experienced the unique thrill of quadratic voting during the Onchain Summer Buildathon, where I felt the power of community and collaboration.\n\nFinally, my NFT is the reflection of that amazing journey, a representation of my growth and my passion for building in this space full of possibilities. üöÄ"

The link points to a json payload hosted on IPFS. The json payload is intended to make up for the fact that Farcaster Embeds are plain links with no additional information that is required in this case (and could be very useful in other use cases too), and provides: file name, file type, file size and the IPFS CID of the file that was shared. This is the equivalent of the RSS <enclosure> tag used in podcasting.\n\nlemon3 is a mini Farcaster client, that connects to a hub: It will show casts containing enclosures from users you follow, and it allows you to share files by uploading them to IPFS and casting the corresponding enclosure.\n\nIt also contains an embedded IPFS server, so you don‚Äôt have to run your own.\n\nVersion 0.1.1 is the MVP: You can upload and share files, and you can find and download files shared by others."

Since childhood, I have been drawn to photography, perhaps it was because my grandfather was also into photography and at home he had an old film camera and a printing laboratory.\n\nSo my journey into photography began as a childhood dream, but it took a profound turn when I experienced an episode teetering on the edge of life and death. This pivotal moment prompted me to realize my passion for creating art, recognizing that I have only one life to fulfill this calling.\n\nI am a dreamer and a romantic, and I like to convey the feeling of unreality in my photography; the fragile feeling of magic in the frame is important to me. I like it to feel like a dream.\n\nMy photography is about life in imaginary worlds. Angels and mermaids exist there, whatever you want can be there. I am fascinated by the connection between nature and people, and I feel a fragile calm in this connection.\n\nMost of my art created during the war and I want to make culture of Ukraine more visible in the art world!\n\n\"Light\" collection is capturing moments of life from Angel. Water of heaven, light of love, worlds in eyes. All and nothing. Forgotten soul in lost dreamworld. "

LogX does not only integrate with other composable protocols, but other protocols can also integrate LogX. Applications like wallets, copy trading platforms, analytics platforms, etc. can find seamless composability with LogX.\n\nThis is important to us because LogX would not have existed if not for the composability of other protocols. We owe our existence to it, and want to ensure that other protocols and apps can build on top of LogX to unlock new value props."

We like to be able to promote the artwork and its creator in this way.\n\nWe do irls workshops, for training, and debates on web3 where doubts come out, topics about what happens in crypto art, and from where also come out collections and artworks.\n\n**Artists and Local Context**\n\nThe participating artists come from Tucum√°n, the broader NOA region, and various rural areas. Their works reflect both contemporary digital art practices and regional cultural influences. By presenting their tokenized art in this exhibition, the festival will serve as a bridge, connecting local creativity with the Web3 space.\n\n**How was it formed?**\n\nIt began with the possibility of helping artists from our immediate environment, from Tucum√°n, from the interior of Argentina and from the peripheries of the country. To be able to make their art visible in the digital world.\n\nDue to the scarce resources for artists in these geographical areas, and the lack of knowledge of digitality and even more of web3, we decided to investigate and train ourselves to make their art visible and help in a possible monetization of theirs works."

Building on the traditional Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), the CPI provided a nuanced perspective by evaluating the voting power of delegates and the roles of various governance bodies, including the Token House and Citizen House. Additionally, we examined the Nakamoto Coefficient to assess the minimum number of members needed to control a majority of voting power, allowing us to compare our findings for the Optimism Collective with those of other prominent DAOs like Compound, Aave, and Uniswap. This research was intended to inform future governance decisions, ensuring the Collective remained fair, transparent, and truly decentralized as it grew and evolved.\n\nOur team consisted of three members who contributed to this project. Chain-l used his experience in the blockchain industry and DAOs to guide the development of the Concentration of Power Index and managed the overall research project. ARDev focused on data analysis, using his skills in ETL processes and Dune Analytics to gather and visualize the data collected, which informed our comparisons with other DAOs. Dhruvi contributed to data visualization to create clear and compelling dashboards that presented our findings in an accessible way, helping to illustrate the power dynamics within the Optimism Collective. Together, our combined efforts ensured a thorough and insightful analysis to be presented to the DAO and community members."

    "description": "Minibridge is a \"zero-fee\" cross-chain tool that offers multi-chain support for BTC/EVM/non-EVM and features such as fast transactions. It was developed by the Chaineye team specifically for users' small-amount transfer scenarios. Launched for less than half a year, Minibridge has already processed 300K transactions and served 100K Web3 users. In user ratings on dappsheriff.com, Minibridge ranks first among all cross-chain bridge projects and was awarded \"Best Tool of the Year\" in the \"PARTY AWARD 2024\" annual selection by PA News.\n\nKey Features\n\nChaineye was born from the Web3 community and we build products for the community‚Äôs needs. To better serve the community, Chaineye has built many free tools such as Onchain Map, CEX Transfer Fees, Multichain Gas, RPC List, etc. The Mini Bridge was designed specifically for retail investors with small-amount cross-chain transfer requests, including the following features:\n\nZero bridge fees: We don‚Äôt charge any bridge fees at all. This means users will get the same amount of assets on the destination chains. We are built for retail investors and we believe our community like free services. Only a minimum gas fee on the destination chain is charged.\n\nFastest transactions: Our bridge has the fastest bridging experience across all existing bridges. The bridging time largely depends on the confirmation time of source and destination blockchains. We don‚Äôt want our users to wait any longer than the evitable blockchain transaction time.\n\nDesigned especially for small-amount transfer scenarios such as gas refill, airdrop claiming, moving funds, etc. It helps to save huge money and time for individual investors when doing so.\n\nGas swap: Our community wants to use the destination chain directly after bridging. We get it! The gas swap feature allows users to swap a small amount of source chain ETH to the destination chain native gas token. It is very useful for those chains where ETH is not the native gas token such as BNB Chain, Polygon, ZetaChain, ZkFair, Avalanche, Map, Mantle, and Metis.\n\nFast Integration: Our team is monitoring the market closely and is ready to integrate the latest blockchains in time. Chaineye Mini Bridge currently supports a total of 24 networks including the latest Blast EVM L2 and Merlin BTC L2 blockchain.\n\nOpen API: We have opened the API docs on our documentation site. Any individuals or third parties can go through the API and seamlessly integrate Mini Bridge into their application. Chaineye Mini Bridge works in the same style for both requests from our front-end UI and API endpoints.\n\nSecurity: To prevent the potential security concern of smart contracts, we have implemented our bridge in a hybrid style - a combination of EOA and smart contracts. EOA for cross-chain transfers and smart contracts for cross-chain gas swaps. It helps to reduce the possibility of contract exploitation. In addition, we have our entire system audited and scrutinized by our security partners.\n\nRewards and Earn: Our users can enjoy a big bridge discount by participating in our various marketing campaigns. In addition, they can also earn referral rewards in ETH and $pMNB whenever their referred address makes a transfer. Everything is transparent and Chaineye Mini Bridge is built for the community.\n\nValue Proposition\nMiniBridge extends its liquidity aggregation services to all major OP stacks, including Optimism, Base, Zora, Mode, Fraxtal, and Redstone, enabling community users on all other chains to interact with the OP ecosystem. We are aiming to foster collaboration and engagement between our respective communities, helping OP and Chaineye users to transfer their assets freely across any supported blockchains with the lowest fees and the highest speed. \nMiniBridge was born from the community and built for the community. Our web3 community BitEye having over 300K active users is the largest Asian crypto community. MiniBridge will help bring BitEye to OP ecosystem with many highlights and marketing resources which will help both sides to grow into the next level. \nMiniBridge address on most blockchains is an EOA: 0x00000000000007736e2F9aA5630B8c812E1F3fc9. Since the birth of MiniBridge (roughly 6 months ago), it has made cumulatively 338,031 bridging transactions on all chains and 28,705 bridging transactions on Optimism and all supported OP stack blockchains. \n\nProject Resource\n\nWebsite: https://minibridge.chaineye.tools/\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Chaineye_tools\n\nTelegram: https://t.me/chaineye\n\nGithub: https://github.com/DeFiEye\n\nDocumentation: https://docs.chaineye.tools/\n"

Mismir is a fashion brand that aims to help people express themselves more, feel empowered, empower others, and connect more with one another and themselves.\nEach garment of the brand will be chipped, with the chips containing the true value of the piece of clothing. The NFC chips serve as a bridge between the physical and digital worlds, the latter being mostly active on-chain as we have NFTs, POAPs, and soon other elements to be added that will live on-chain. Not all of them can be added on-chain for now, but most of them will.\nCurrently, as the tangible garments are still under production, I am trying with Mismir to make our presence felt within the on-chain world. We are actively expressing ourselves on Farcaster and Lens, occasionally having our manifestations minted on platforms like Zora and chains like Base. The reason for not moving fully to Zora with our content, and preferring to alternate with Lens, is that we believe in diversity and in the future that Lens is creating for brands like ours, artists, builders, and curators.\nWithin the brand's ecosystem, there is a series called Storied Strokes which celebrates the transformative power of artistry and the vibrant voices shaping our world. We are taking the voices and stories of artists, turning them into articles, and through the platform we've built thus far, we are spreading them into the world. The main reason is to empower the artists who bring so much good to our lives. The interviews are first posted on Mirror, where we are leveraging the power of the blockchain to ensure that these articles can live on forever, and then on our website, where they can be accessible to more people who are not familiar with or who are skeptical about the on-chain world. We are using the Optimism chain to have our articles minted on-chain!"

Lending markets are isolated from each other, protecting users, while still allowing lending vaults to allocate across multiple markets for diversification and complex strategies.\n\n\n\nWorld‚Äôs DeFi ecosystem is nascent, yet there are already 24 million unique users. Given this novelty, Morpho‚Äôs growth on World is positioned to be the first step on the DeFi journey for millions of users around the globe. DeFi applications can leverage the expansiveness and organic growth of the World ecosystem‚Äôs features, including World ID, World App, World Chain, Mini Apps, and more, to scale their usage natively and with far less friction compared to more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù DeFi feature sets and UX environments. Moreover, DeFi applications can continue to scale within the World network without having to compete for the same set of users and capital already captured by DeFi apps deployed on other chains.\n\n\n\nThe launch of Morpho aims to result in a distribution of just over $1,000,000 in WLD  over the first three months to further grow TVL by approximately $25,000,000 by the end of June. This comfortably exceeds Grants Council targets. The campaign aims to make it easier and more rewarding for participants in Morpho‚Äôs markets to attract and deploy assets, as well as use Morpho‚Äôs vault features, which increases the liquidity available to borrowers and encourages the supply of collateral assets.

In contrast to the bi-section game, which demands log2(N) moves to identify the final disputable step, the K-section game (where K > 2) diminishes the moves to logK(N). However, in the K-section game, each player (defender/attacker) must publish a K-1 VM state hashes on-chain with every move. The introduction of EIP-4844 facilitates a substantial reduction in this cost through the utilization of EIP-4844 Binary Large Object (BLOB), capable of accommodating K=4096 VM hashes per BLOB. Consequently, for an N=2^48 game, the game can be condensed to 4 moves from the original 48 moves."

Our goal is to provide a verifiable and user-friendly solution that ensures easy access and authenticity of race records.\n\n# The Problem & Our Solution\nCompletion certificates are often lost, difficult to verify, or susceptible to forgery. Managing multiple certificates across different races is also a challenge for runners. MyRunWallet addresses these issues by securely storing certificates on the blockchain while ensuring privacy by removing personally identifiable information. Runners can access their verified records anytime, anywhere.\n\n# How We Utilize Blockchain\nBlockchain ensures that each certificate is tamper-proof and permanently recorded, providing a decentralized and immutable verification system without reliance on centralized entities.\n\n# Impact & Benefits\nFor Runners: Easy access to verified certificates, reducing the risk of loss or falsification.\nFor Race Organizers: Streamlined issuance and fraud-resistant certificate management.\nFor the Ecosystem: Enhancing trust and transparency in digital race records"

Compared to ERC-4337, which relies on off-chain components, Native Account Abstraction offers advantages such as lower gas fees for users (approximately 40% reduction) and a more consistent experience for builders. Because of these benefits, we believe that Account Abstraction should be enshrined within the protocol, and we have been continuously working towards this goal.\n\nOne of the most important aspects is conducting all development processes in an open environment, and making it easy for anyone to test. To achieve this, Kroma team launched the public devnet Pioneer Alpha, which incorporates RIP-7560, RIP-7711, and RIP-7712 into the OP Stack. Additionally, we have developed an RIP-7560 compatible bundler in Golang, based on Stackup's bundler, and provide a Blockscout page and scripts that allow anyone to easily verify and test these implementations."

However, the high cost of early NFTs was a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Discovering Optimistic Layer 2 (OP L2) was a game-changer for us. It enabled us to issue affordable NFTs at a fraction of the cost, opening the door for a broader audience.\n\nThis strategic pivot to L2 was met with remarkable success. We have issued millions of NFTs, democratizing access to digital assets. Our most popular NFT boasts over 100,000 holders, a testament to our approach of making NFTs accessible and valuable across multiple blockchains.\n\nOur vision is to continue this trajectory, enhancing the utility and engagement of our NFTs. We are committed to innovating and expanding the functionalities of our NFTs, ensuring they offer more than just ownership‚Äîcreating new ways for holders to interact with and benefit from their digital assets."

    "description": "Open Source Observer is a public good that helps communities measure impact and improve grant effectiveness. During Retro Funding 4 (Onchain Builders), we collaborated closely with the Citizens House to develop a comprehensive suite of onchain impact metrics and power the first \"metrics-based voting\" experiment.\n\nWe created a first-of-its-kind data pipeline for the Superchain: not only the data but also all source code, query logic, and underlying infrastructure is publicly available for use. With data generously provided by Goldsky, we built a unified Superchain event model covering all OP Stack chains (OP Mainnet, Base, Fraxtal, Metal, Mode, and Zora). We wrote custom logic for discovering contract deployments and attributing them to specific projects per RF4 requirements. With our friends at OpenRank, Passport, and the OP Labs data team, we designed a \"trusted user model\", intended to identify transaction and onchain activity from high reputation users. These models provided the foundation for calculating a range of quantitative indicators to assess the contributions of onchain builders across these chains. All methodologies, data sources, and analysis tools used in developing these metrics are publicly available.\n\nWe also maintain an important community resource called OSS Directory: a public repository of Optimism projects and their associated GitHub repos, NPM packages, deployers, contracts, and other open source artifacts, with a strict schema and validation logic to ensure consistency. There are more than 500 Optimism projects in the directory, with new submissions and updates coming in every week. During the RF4 sign-up period, we received 50+ new submissions and made numerous updates to existing projects. \n\nThe journey to arrive at a final set of onchain impact metrics was iterative and collaborative. We worked closely with the Foundation and badgeholders to discover and refine the metrics through workshops, surveys, and asynchronous feedabck. This collaboration not only provided valuable insights for Retro Funding 4 but also laid the groundwork for more sophisticated impact assessment in subsequent rounds.\n\nIn all the work leading up to the final voting, we maintained our commitment to openness and reproducibility, and wrote extensively about the process to arrive at the final set of metrics on our blog and the Optimism governance forum."

The appropriate proof is automatically selected based on the configuration of the OP Stack chain.\n\nThe Opti.Domains ENS Gateway automatically upgrades in response to the OP Stack's transition from L2OutputOracle to Dispute Game, requiring no manual intervention or updates to the verifier contract or gateway server.\n\nThe ENS Gateway, specifically the EVMGateway, enables trustless cross-chain data retrieval for ENS names deployed on Layer 2 networks like Optimism with a CCIP Gateway. When an ENS name lookup occurs, the resolver reverts with OffchainLookup containing the gateway URL. The client then contacts the gateway, which returns the requested data. This data is passed to a callback function on the resolver for verification before being returned to the client as the final result of the name lookup.\n\nOur ENS Gateway has a mechanism to ensure liveliness even in the event that the respected dispute game type has suddenly changed, as seen in the recent proposal, 'Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade,' by storing a backup dispute game type and only trusting its anchor state.\n\nOpti.Domains has also developed social verification and attestation to EAS in collaboration with Bored Town. We are on our way to scaling ENS to OP. We have contributed to the ENS OP Gateway development, which is currently under review by ENS core developers.\n\nThe Namespace team has expressed interest and reached out to us with questions about using our OP ENS Gateway.

Notable users are Blockaid, Chainstack, Blockjoy, etc. \n\nIn the Superchain‚Äôs vision, disk space is a huge problem. For example, the sum of OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora‚Äôs OP Geth archive node size is 16.16TB. On the other hand, OP Erigon only costs 3.55 TB, which is a 78% savings. Considering the challenger nodes need to run all nodes in Superchain with the interop future, leveraging OP Erigon is a huge win.\n\nSince Retro Funding round 3, Test in Prod has worked on the following:\n- Support users to run & troubleshoot OP-Erigon.\n- Update the up-to-date upstream codes.\n- Port Erigon 3, which saves 90.9% of disk footprint compared to Geth on L1.\n- Host the archive node snapshots for OP Mainnet, OP Sepolia, and Base Mainnet‚Äî350+ downloads per month.\n- Host the public RPC of OP Erigon & Otterscan, which serves 4.9k requests/day on average.\n\n---\nHere are the commentaries from the notable users: \n\nRaz (CTO of Blockaid): With OP-Erigon, Blockaid could protect users in the Optimism ecosystem (OP Mainnet, Base, and Zora) more effectively by leveraging its efficient disk space and performance. Moreover, working with Sunnyside Labs is a smooth experience‚Äîthey help us troubleshoot, notify us of upcoming network upgrades, etc. We think their works are impactful, at least for us. \n\nEugene (CTO of Chainstack): Chainstack is using op-erigon for Global Elastic Nodes in OP Mainnet & Base. Thanks to op-erigon, we could run the archive nodes for the Optimism ecosystem more efficiently. Test in Prod was also helpful for the node operations by helping us troubleshoot, alerting us for upcoming upgrades, etc.\n\nChris (CEO of Blockjoy): Blockjoy provides dedicated unmetered op-erigon node services for customers needing high performance Erigon RPCs; notable customers are Trueblocks, Blockaid, etc. Operating nodes as efficiently as possible can require true expertise, this is why we enjoy working with Test in Prod & hope to continue working with them in the future!"

At the time, I realized there were no public accountability for delegates meanwhile lots of them receive huge amount of votes. And to help the collective better monitor delegates, especially the top 100 of them, I consult with people like Justine (OP head of gov), Ross (a16z), Michael Silberling (OP Data), and lots of delegates on the metrics to track for governance. \n\nThus, I created 2 public dune dashboards for the OP Collective to track the governance \"performance\" of its delegates. One is for the top 100 delegates. The other is for the a16z Optimism Delegates (including university clubs, professional delegate groups, and a few crypto native delegates. They track votes participations, voting powers, voting rationales, and other relevant metrics (on both individual level and the aggregate level). It help the OP collective to identify active and inactive delegates (with lots of voting power) to reward accordingly and conduct liquid delegation when performance degrades. It also help the delegators  such as a16z's and others to know which smaller voting power delegates are active in governance: offering them a platform for delegators to know more about them.   "

Through practical deployments, benchmarking, and innovative proposals, this project seeks to push the boundaries of Optimistic Rollup performance and functionality, contributing to the broader goal of Ethereum scalability.\n\nThe project covers several key areas. First, the Node & Rollup Setup involved detailed documentation of the deployment process for both an L1 node (Holesky testnet) and an L2 rollup using the OP Stack. To address RPC calls limitations, the project transitioned from relying on a remote virtual machine and third-party RPC services to a local environment. This shift improved performance reliability and security.\n\nIn the OP Stack Version Benchmarking, multiple test deployments were conducted to compare the OP Stack versions V4.0.0 (Canyon) and V7.0.0 (Fjord). Significant findings from these tests included a 75% reduction in total gas fees when upgrading from V4.0.0 to V7.0.0. Additionally, a comparison of calldata versus data blob methods revealed that using data blobs resulted in a 60% reduction in resource usage, demonstrating the efficiency gains of advanced data handling techniques.\n\nFor the Proposed Changes to Fault Proofs, the project explored integrating the OP Stack's Canon Fault Proofs VM with the opML's Multi-Phase Fault Proof protocol. The proposed modifications included developing a state transition function model to handle merkelized decision trees or neural network outputs. The project also focused on analyzing memory management strategies for handlig large datasets required by machine learning models, and enhancing syscalls and I/O operations to optimize the ML-driven data processing. To ensure system integrity, formal verification, and error analysis were implemented. Additionally, simulations were developed to evaluate the system's performance under real-world operational conditions."

Multiple\n\nHow will this Mission Request help accomplish the above Intent?\n\nStarting from the fact that OP token holders tend not to feel confident due to lack of context (not so much of the update proposal but of the implications it has), the proposal is to bring in voices that have expressed different opinions on the matter (of an update with more than 15% vetos) and make them delve deeper into their motives.\n\nIn this way, by facilitating a safe space for conversation, we can use conflict as a means to strengthen ties between various parties and enable token holders and delegates who want to gain context to listen to different positions and form their own opinion.\n\nBelow the proposal for the structure of the space (assuming 1:30 hrs):\n\n10 min - Landing and check-in\n10 min - Framing of the topic (by Facilitation Team)\n20 min - Veto debate (by two opposing voices)\n10 min - Breakout Rooms\n20 min - Questions and answers (by panelist and citizens)\n20 min - Collective harvesting\n\nAlthough, there may also be spaces for discussion on key issues that are about to be voted on. In this format, small discussion groups can be set up to promote peer learning.\n\nProcess:\n\n- When a proposal goes beyond having more than 15% vetos, a call is opened for portfolios that have already voted (and who perceive they have a very strong position on the matter) to participate in a space with a specific date.\n- The facilitating team (of around 3 people) contacts the people chosen as panelists and establishes behavioral agreements to maintain a safe and respectful space.\n- A publication is made with the public event. Those people who register can receive an attestation of attendance if they participate.\n- The call is facilitated by a team, allowing citizens to listen and express themselves.\n- A record and minute is made that summarizes the points (which can be translated into infographics, memes and other content to trigger the conversation in Fancaster and other channels).\n\n\nWhat is required to execute this Mission Request?\n\nFacilitation Team is responsible for:\n\n- call, selection and preparation of panelists\n- facilitation of sessions to guarantee harvest of learning\n- creation of materials that facilitate sense-making for citizens who have not been able to attend.\n- How should governance participants measure impact upon completion of this Mission?\n\nMilestones:\n\nToken holders and delegates attendance at sessions\nParticipation of token holders in voting on Optimism DAO \n\nMetrics:\n\nIncrease of total votable supply of OP, highlighted as a core metric in Intent 1‚Äôs ratification\nIncrease in number of voters in Optimism DAO"

This tool abstracts away the complexity of deploying an Optimism-based chain, making it easier for developers to focus on building their applications rather than managing infrastructure.\n\nWhy OP Stack CLI?\nThe OP Stack is a powerful framework for building rollups, but the initial setup can be daunting. OP Stack CLI simplifies this process, allowing developers to quickly spin up a rollup with minimal effort. This tool is particularly useful for developers who want to experiment with Optimism-based chains or build custom rollups without getting bogged down by the intricacies of deployment."

Optimist addresses this challenge by leveraging the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), providing a platform where community feedback not only leads the way in determining the trustworthiness of Dapps and their decisions but also serves as a crucial component for the continuous improvement of these applications. By facilitating a constant feedback loop and utilizing the robust capabilities of EAS for secure and verifiable attestations, Optimist empowers developers to refine and enhance their offerings based on real user experiences and insights.\n\nFeatures\n- Home Page: Displays a list of registered Dapps along with their community ratings. Users can search and filter through the list to find applications of interest.\n- Dapp Registration: Allows users to register new Dapps on the platform, ensuring the database is continually updated with the latest applications.\n- Dapp Rating and Reviews: Users can leave detailed reviews and rate Dapps, contributing to the overall trust score of each application.\n- My Reviews: Users can view and manage their review history, with options to update or delete their past contributions.\n\nFuture Directions\nGovernance Integration: The next phase includes incorporating features to review and rate governance proposals directly on Optimism. This extension will empower users to actively participate in the governance processes of their favorite Dapps.\nCross-Blockchain Support: Optimist is already equipped to support applications across various blockchains.

    "description": "Introduction\n\nOptimism brought us retrospective funding, and we aim to complement it with proactive funding. Our vision is straightforward: fund builders within the Optimism Collective for the work they are doing right now and in the future. Not solely for what they have done in the past.\n\nWe aim to leverage decentralized finance (DeFi), particularly the yield-bearing stablecoin ecosystem, to create a stablecoin that serves the Optimism Collective‚Äôs largest stablecoin portfolios. By tapping into decentralized lending markets, this stablecoin will generate yield and equitably distribute it to all grantees approved by Optimism‚Äôs Grant Council. This approach bridges the funding gap, supporting grantees during their 12-month OP token vesting period while recognizing their active contributions and risks.\n\nWhy Another Stablecoin?\n\nStablecoins already play a crucial role as a refuge for large treasuries, and our solution preserves this utility while extending its impact within the Collective. The Optimistic Builder Dollar (obUSD) takes advantage of existing DeFi markets to proactively fund grantees of Optimism‚Äôs builder rounds. This complements the retroactive funding model set by the Optimism Collective and provides grantees with trust and financial security during the 12-month lock-up period of builder grants. View obUSD token contract\n\nHow It Works\n\nThe Optimistic Builder Dollar is built on three key components:\n\nMinting and Burning\n\n- Yield Generation\n- Cohort Creation\n- Minting and Burning\n\nMinting obUSD begins with users depositing USDC into a yield-bearing lending protocol. We will be using Aave V3 USDC market on Optimism. In return, users receive obUSD, which maintains a value equal to 1 US dollar. Users can burn obUSD at any time to redeem their deposited USDC.\n\nAs an ERC-20 token, obUSD can be freely traded, used for payments, or utilized in various DeFi protocols built on Optimism. (Hint: We are already looking into making obUSD a superchainERC-20 for an improved user experience)\n\nYield Generation\nDeposited stablecoins (USDC) are routed to on-chain lending markets, where they generate an annual percentage yield (APY). The yield generation process is transparent and happens in real time, making it an open and verifiable mechanism for fund generation.\n\nCohort Creation\n\nWhat sets obUSD apart is its innovative cohort creation mechanism, starting with grantees from Optimism's Governance Season 6. This involves two key events:\n\nGrant Council Attestations: A project must have an attestation from the Optimism Grants Council confirming approval as a builder grant recipient.\n\nCommunity Endorsements: The project must receive endorsements from at least three Optimism Citizens (including badge holders and guest voters) via our application.\n\nProjects meeting these criteria are automatically added to the obUSD yield-receiving cohort. Membership duration is currently set at 8 months following the attestation issuance date.\n\n(Note: The number of required endorsements may change as the project evolves.)View obUSD Cohort selection page\n\nYield Distribution\n\nYield generated by the obUSD protocol is distributed equally among projects in the cohort every month. For example:\n\nIf 10 projects are in the cohort and the monthly yield is 10,000 obUSD, each project receives 1,000 obUSD (~1,000 USD).\n\nThis yield is automatically distributed to the OP rewards recipient address of each project.\n\nWe are here for you, the builders\nRetrofunding grants are empowering when you already have funds. But for projects starting out, proactive funding can be the difference between success and stagnation. Together, we can make a difference for the Optimism Collective‚Äôs builders.\n\nLet‚Äôs build a future where proactive funding meets retroactive rewards.\n\nKeep the funds flowing. All yield to OP builders!\n\nOptimistic Builder dollar is a Breadchain solidarity solution.\n\n"

    "description": "Optimystics Tools is a suite of open-source software designed to empower communities with innovative governance solutions on the Superchain. Our toolkit, centered around the Respect Game, includes applications for decentralized decision-making, reputation management, and collective action. Since October 2023, we've been developing and refining these tools, which form the technical foundation of Optimism Fractal's weekly events.\n\nOur initial toolset laid the groundwork for fractal democracy experiments, enabling peer-reviewed contribution evaluation and democratic council formation. This has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of governance tools, including a comprehensive Respect Games app for gamified governance, Fractalgram app for live community engagement, and ORDAO smart contracts for optimistic, respect-based onchain execution. By providing this infrastructure, we've created a laboratory for governance innovation within the Optimism ecosystem. Our tools have not only supported Optimism Fractal but have also been adopted by other communities, demonstrating their versatility and potential for wider impact in decentralized governance.\n\nThis work has not been funded by the Collective outside of the RetroPGF Round 3 grant shown below, which supported the team who started Optimism Fractal as well as our work with several other related projects. Please see Optimystics.io/projects-and-funding for details on our funding and related projects."

It's the perfect name for a room that will be used for animals to decompress before they are diagnosed at the animal hospital onsite.\n\nThis governance vote introduced a new community of Base lovers to the Pawthereum project. Users who participated in this vote were airdropped Pawthereum tokens when Pawthereum migrated from Ethereum mainnet to Base in April. If they enjoyed using tokens to vote on fun governance proposals that help animals, they have like minded frens in the Pawthereum community!\n\nThe vote was conducted in a farcaster frame or on Pawthereum's custom build interface: Pawswap. Most users chose to vote via the frame and as far as I am aware, this is the first frame used for an onchain governance proposal! (Coinbase's frame followed shortly after with a vote on branding for a liquid death advertisement)."

This system allowed anyone to become a validator, who submits checkpoint outputs to L1 and validates them, thereby enabling the decentralized settlement of Kroma on L1.\n\nAdditionally, it reduced the costs associated with resolving disputes between different checkpoint outputs. It identifies the disputed point at the block level using multiple segments instead of bisection, requiring far fewer transactions. Moreover, it doesn‚Äôt necessitate storing large amounts of preimage oracle data on-chain, as verification can be achieved through ZK proofs. Operationally, we enhanced the ZK prover by reducing proof generation time using Tachyon, a Kroma original, GPU accelerated ZK backend library written in C++.\n\nHowever, there were several limitations in the existing system:\n- Maintaining the zkEVM circuit was challenging.\n- It did not guarantee that the execution of transactions was based on the batch data posted by the sequencer.\n- Compatibility with the interface of Optimism's DisputeGame was not considered.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the Kroma team is developing an advanced ZK Fault Proof system using a zkVM. By using zkVM instead of zkEVM, no additional maintenance efforts are required for the ZK circuit. The new proving scheme ensures that transaction execution is based on the batch data posted by the sequencer. Additionally, the contract for dispute challenges will implement the interface of Optimism‚Äôs DisputeGame, making it fully compatible with Optimism's system. We anticipate that this could become one of the various dispute game types in the multi-proof system."

    "description": "Protocol Guild is a funding collective for 181 Ethereum Layer 1 R&D maintainers.¬†These individuals come from 27 different ecosystem teams/projects and are the backbone of Ethereum's core protocol development. Protocol Guild ensures that funding goes directly to these individuals and Ethereum stewardship over the long term.\n----------------------------------\n\n--> Optimism's relationship with the Ethereum commons\n\nThe Ethereum commons is a broad set of peer-produced artifacts which share infrastructure or software resources. Optimism shares both with the Ethereum L1:\n\n1. Infrastructure relationships link the censorship resistance, security, and settlement of OP-stack L2s with the L1 network.\n\n2. Software powers the L1 distributed system and extensions of it, produced in part by the ongoing research and development of contributors supported through Protocol Guild. These individuals come from 27 different ecosystem teams and projects:\n\n- Client teams: Erigon, EthereumJS, Geth, Besu, Lighthouse, Lodestar, Nethermind, Nimbus, Prysm, Reth and Teku\n- Research groups: Applied Research Group, Consensys DDS, Consensus R&D, Ipsilon, Robust Incentives Group, Stateless Consensus and TXRX\n- Coordination & support groups: EELS, EthPandaOps, EthereumJS, EF Protocol Support, EF Protocol Security, EF Testing, Ethereum Cat Herders and Portal‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã\n\nOther impact includes:\n\n- the research, testing, and introduction of blobs through EIP-4844 (ie. proto-danksharding) in March 2024, has lowered L2 transaction costs by 10-100X\n- ongoing research into peerDAS and related constructions for the anticipated Pectra network upgrade, which will potentially lower the bandwidth requirements and/or further lower transaction costs for users\n- Optimism‚Äôs execution clients are modified L1 clients, which are maintained by Guild members\n- research, implementations, testing of EVM improvements. Optimism's EVM-equivalent architecture, makes the ecosystem more accessible to builders\n- ongoing maintainence of code-bases, support for network upgrades to make Ethereum more censorship resistant, secure, and accessible\n---------------------------------------\n\n--> A commons funding mechanism\n\nNo single individual/project could reproduce this software on their own. In recognition of this, the design of Protocol Guild is also grounded within the commons frame:\n\n1. Four year onchain vest, to individuals\n\nCommons stewardship plays out over time. Any funding drips slowly via immutable contracts to create legible guarantees for members + funders. Each member's share is time-weighted by their start date - which recognizes the local knowledge they've accumulated.\n\n2. Broad membership, regularly updated\n\nMembers come from +25 projects/teams across the entire Layer 1 contributor set. This wide-ranging curation ensures that less well known but equally impactful contributions are surfaced.\nThis membership is regularly updated onchain every quarter. When paired with the vest, this ensures funding goes to contributors that stick around long-term, or those that show up in the future - not just those that are around today.\n\nThrough these features, Protocol Guild is able to support long-term, transparent, & comprehensive Layer 1 stewardship.\n\n---------------------------\n--> \"Project\", not \"Org\"\n\nWithin the Retro Program context, Protocol Guild opts to represent itself as a \"Project\" instead of as an \"Organization.\"\n\n1. Fund the entire commons\n\nProtocol Guild aims to holistically fund the individuals engaged in Ethereum's core protocol , and not \"features\" or discrete projects of the protocol which will then compete against each other in the funding round.\n\n2. Funding, not project oversight\n\nProtocol Guild is scope-limited to allocate funding. The day-to-day activities of Ethereum projects/teams are not directed through Protocol Guild as an entity, or by any members in their affiliation as beneficiaries. Governance deliberations and roadmap decisions remain the responsibility of the broader community reaching rough consensus in public fora.\n\n3. Independent funding requests\n\nPresenting as an Organization with Projects might overlap with funding requests from individual core protocol projects/teams in the Retro round. These entities may have contributors/employees which are also members of Protocol Guild. However, these are are distinct entities from Protocol Guild itself. Protocol Guild funding goes directly to the individuals. In general, the membership does not have insight where this funding goes or how it is allocated.\n------------------------------\n\n--> Conclusion\n\nProtocol Guild‚Äôs design as a funding collective for individual Ethereum maintainers ensures that the network's ongoing evolution is sufficiently supported. By funding Protocol Guild through the Retro Program, badgeholders can ensure that it remains robust and capable of supporting innovations like Optimism.\n\nThank you for your consideration ‚ù§Ô∏è"

It is a public good team funded by the Ethereum Foundation with ~10 people who each possess different areas of expertise and experience. Through coordination, meticulous code reviews, developing and utilizing advanced tooling, and running real-world simulations, our focus is on securing the network and its critical components. Our hands-on approach includes managing the bug bounty program, continuously monitoring the network, and collaborating with client teams and many other teams in the ecosystem. We‚Äôre committed to help identifying and mitigating risks to Ethereum network. The Protocol Security Research team is often not the most visible team in public, both due to the nature of what we work on, but also as we primarily try to help empower people in the ecosystem.\n\nCoordination & Collaboration\nWe spend time coordinating and and collaborating with many parts of the ecosystem in order to further help keep Ethereum safe. Some of the things we do are:\n    Vulnerability coordination and collaboration with L2s, L1s, critical dependencies and more for security issues\n    Protocol Security call series\n    Coordination and collaboration with external security auditors for protocol related audits\n    Security coordination and collaboration with client teams and critical dependencies\n    Coordination and collaboration with researchers from the Ethereum ecosystem, Academia and Security\n    Collaboration with teams such as Devops and Testing\n    On-going collaboration and support for grantees\n    Support public good projects related to security\n    Writing the \"Secured\" series on the EF Blog\n\nBug Bounty Program\nThe Protocol Security Research team manage the Ethereum Foundation Bug Bounty Program.

The bug bounty program cover the Protocol, Clients, the Solidity compiler and more.\nWe also keep a public repository of past results at https://github.com/ethereum/public-disclosures/\n\nGrants\nWe feel that providing resources and funding to security grants is impactful and valuable to the ecosystem. In our opinion, providing funding is often critical, however we also provide our own time as a resource in order to further help projects be successful. Some of the grants we work on are:\n    Provide and support Academic Grants through funding and resources\n    We are an active supporte of the Ethereum Protocol Fellowship by providing resources\n    We provide resources for the Devcon(nect) Scholars\n    We provide funding and resources for General Security Grants\n        Grants for various security efforts, such as The Red Guild, Security Alliance, or fuzzers created by external people such as Guido Vranken\n\nFuzzing\nThere is a finite amount of time for manual audits, so we build, maintain and use fuzzers to increase the likelihood of finding vulnerabilities.

Since the QR never changes, we can continue to compound its distribution over time to bring an increasing amount of attention to our auction winners.\n\nNear-term: most of the attention will be driven through notifications sent to farcaster users, and other mostly digital drivers of attention. Our daily winner announcements have each received thousands or tens of thousands of views and our daily distribution should only get larger with time. So far, we have helped tokens increase market cap, projects add new users, and charities raise money, among many other use cases.\n\nThere is a cryptocurrency connected to the project called QR coin ($QR).\n\nThe contract address is: 0x2b5050F01d64FBb3e4Ac44dc07f0732BFb5ecadF\n\nGo to qrcoin.fun, sign up with your email address, and pay with Apple Pay or credit card in a few clicks. If you‚Äôre into crypto, you can optionally connect your wallet to pay with USDC.\n\nIf and when you are outbid, you get your money back immediately.\n\nWe have used and plan to continue to use a portion of the revenues from our daily auctions to buy $QR. This auction-driven demand for the coin should theoretically allow people who believe in the project to bet on its success by buying and holding $QR. If and as the project becomes more popular over time, the price of the coin could increase accordingly. This relationship between the project's success and the QR coin's price should incentivize $QR holders from around the world to help promote the project."

The purpose of these simulations is to test aspects of voting mechanisms quantitatively. Specifically, we are interested in testing how various voting mechanisms (such as Quorum + Threshold, or Pairwise) compare along the following dimensions:  1) capital allocation efficiency, 2) robustness to COI (conflict of interest), and 3) robustness to collusion. \n\nOur summary findings, which are detailed in the project resources, are:\nWhen controlling for badgeholder laziness and expertise, the pairwise voting mechanism results in a closer alignment between true project rankings and the rankings inferred by the voting mechanism.\nQuorum+Threshold, across a wide range of parameters, appears more resilient to COI and collusion than Pairwise.\n"

The main advantages for the Ethereum network are:\n1. Lower handshake latency: Establishing a libp2p-capable QUIC connection saves ~3 network roundtrips compared to TCP.\n2. Faster transfer performance due to built-in stream multiplexing, lack of head-of-line blocking, advanced loss recovery and congestion control.\n3.

The collection features artworks from 18 artists, including the GIF art legend Francoise Gamma and other well-known artists in the NFT space.

The collection is also aesthetically diverse, reflecting the versatile techniques and styles of the selected artists.\nI set up the Warpcast quote-art channel on April 9th at the request of the artist Trapers, who wanted to create a channel inspired by the art quoting trend of sharing one's own art based on a given theme. The channel quickly attracted a growing community of some of the best artists, inspiring me to organize a collective drop featuring the most frequent quote-art users.\nFor the first drop, I chose the theme 'Quote Your Summer Art' to celebrate the joy of summertime through creativity and collaboration, embracing the spirit of the on-chain summer movement.

These daily decisions create branching paths of possibility - some circles become massive 1000-pixel rarities, others split and multiply through strategic merging, all while maintaining their pure on-chain genesis.\nWhat Makes It Unique:\nLiving Artwork: SVG images generated entirely on-chain, no IPFS dependencies\nDaily Engagement: 24-hour cooldowns create ritual-like interaction patterns\nStrategic Depth: Merge mechanics allow complex collection strategies and risk/reward decisions\nCommunity Integration: Garden contract enables collective growth experiences\nPure Minimalism: Black circles on white backgrounds - maximum impact, minimal noise\nTechnical Innovation:\nBuilt on Shape L2 with custom ERC721 implementation, our dApp features real-time analytics, leaderboards, and seamless wallet integration. The smart contract handles all metadata generation, creating truly decentralized art.\nArtist Vision:\nWe explore digital ownership through the lens of choice and consequence. Each circle becomes a meditation on growth, scarcity, and the paths we choose. The question \"Which way? Which way?\" isn't just flavor text - it's the core of every interaction.\nSuperchain Future:\nAs Superchain infrastructure expands, Rabbit Hole's portable, on-chain nature positions it perfectly for cross-chain experiences.

Working with collection data, it is not possible to show the physical artworks in their originality, thus re-frame takes an approach of turning computational space into a metaphysical environment by combining a landscape with a still life from different authors into new combinations, resulting in a hybrid, multidimensional area of outdoor, indoor, mental and associative locations.\n\nThe title and short description of each iteration is generated by combining the available metadata of the selected artworks. Where there is no English translation available, re-frame defaults back to the original Finnish expressions, resulting in a hybrid, unconventional language, specific to the dataset."

TVL has grown to over $160M, 8 major audits have been completed, and a $5M ImmuneFi bug bounty continues to contribute to the safety. Additionally, the overcollateralization to protect against depegs was put to test during the Silicon Valley related USDC depeg in March 2023, which led to a successful re-collateralization of eUSD holders.\n\nOn Base, Reserve Protocol has over $25m TVL on Base, $13m of which is Base Native with the remainder bridged from Mainnet. RTokens are playing a strong role in growing the DeFi ecosystem on Base with several integrations and deep liquidity. RToken pools account for over $30m of Total Pool TVL on Aerodrome alone. Growth of RTokens on Base also has second order benefits for the Base's DeFi ecosystem since RTokens are composed of other assets in the ecosystem. For example, hyUSD is a base-native flatcoin that is 100% backed by a collateral basket of USDC which is supplied on Aave and Compound to earn revenue, which is then distributed to hyUSD holders and governance stakers. The market cap of hyUSD has grown to a point where hyUSD collateral makes up 6% of all USDC supplied on Compound and 4% of all USDC supplied on Aave!\n\nI am Thomas Mattimore, CEO of ABC Labs - the Reserve Protocol Core Team.

The Farcaster user reputation scores computed by OpenRank on an curated engagement graph was used as one of the three major data sources, next to FIDs and Gitcoin Passport. \n\nThe reputation scores are taken from OpenRank Farcaster Global Profile Ranking: Farcaster users are basically categorized into the two strategies: [**following**](https://docs.openrank.com/integrations/farcaster/global-profile-ranking#strategy-following) and [**engagement](https://docs.openrank.com/integrations/farcaster/global-profile-ranking#strategy-engagement), and ranked recursively by incoming and outgoing trusted engagement signals such as recast, comment, likes on their social graph.** This score is made available, open-sourced and verifiable by OpenRank reputation protocol.\n\n[OUR IMPACT]\n\nUsers which rank high on OpenRank scores are acknowledged lost of developers as highly likely to be reputable real users instead of spam, Sybils and scammers. \n\nhttps://gov.optimism.io/t/retro-funding-4-impact-metrics-a-collective-experiment/8226\nAdditionally, Retro 4 also used a metric called OpenRank Trusted User Model, which indicates an even tougher-defined trust.

For example, instead of number of forks, voters can see the number of forks by reputable developers, and they can see the weighted and aggregated reputation scores of all developers who forked this repo. https://gov.optimism.io/t/impact-metrics-for-retro-funding-5/8931\nTL;DR 1min video walk through: https://www.loom.com/share/92ccf283b670477d9bf147f8b66a22e3?sid=9fcf321f-8dd3-4ba7-8221-8a301b9b15d3\n\n[OUR IMPACT] \n\nNow we have reputation scores for 47K repos in Github for their contribution to OP Stack core repos. And these scores are readily available for any developer in OP ecosystem to use.\n\nIntroducing reputation metrics is important because 1) voters need better signals to know if a repo is contributing to OP stack and to what degree is that contribution; 2) voters need signals to know if a repo has been interacted by reputable developers, which adds to an underlying endorsement of the value of the repos. \n\nMore on our work: https://x.com/SahilDewan/status/1839701853258530864\n\n[WHAT IS OpenRank]\n\nOpenRank is a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust. Using graph compute algorithms like EigenTrust, it offers resilience from sybil contexts, provides scalable and context-specific compute, and enables permissionless access to compute and reputation data for any user."

We are developing mechanisms to ensure the L1 protocol maintains chain neutrality by empowering Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized set of validators to enforce the inclusion of transactions in Ethereum blocks through inclusion lists (ILs). Over the past year, we have explored the design space and made significant progress towards a proposal called Fork-Choice Enforced Inclusion Lists (FOCIL), which we believe could be considered for inclusion in a future Ethereum upgrade. We have also collaborated with the Commit-Boost effort to develop out-of-protocol inclusion lists bridging the gap until a protocol solution is available.\n\nTiming games. Nearly a year ago, we named and introduced the concept of timing games in a publication, describing how proposers have an incentive to wait until the last moment to propose their blocks in order to maximize MEV rewards. Since then, we have observed timing games occurring in practice and have been working on mitigation strategies to maintain consensus stability. Timing games were central to critical discussions by the Ethereum research and builder communities over the last year.\n\nPBS. Our group has been at the forefront of PBS research for more than two years now. During the time period considered for this retroactive funding, we have deepened our understanding of the practice of PBS with research supporting EIP-7732 (‚ÄúEnshrined Proposer‚ÄìBuilder Separation‚Äù). We have also been active in exploring MEV burn mechanisms, as well as the newer idea of ‚ÄúAttester‚ÄìProposer Separation‚Äù, with posts and publications.\n\nStaking economics. This group put forward the idea of rainbow staking dealing with an ever-changing staking landscape. It intends to embrace the heterogeneity of Ethereum's staking set and foresees different roles for different types of participants. Separately but related, this group has proposed changes to Ethereum's issuance policy in order to maintain a healthy staking level that is long-term sustainable. \n\nIf any of this catches your attention, please take a look at rig.ethereum.org to find links to all resources."

Rundler is designed to achieve high-performance and high-reliability in cloud deployments via a modular architecture.\n\nBuilt, maintained, and used by Alchemy to push the limits of user experience on EVM chains via Account Abstraction.\n\nGoals\nRundler is meant to power the ERC-4337 ecosystem with an implementation that users can rely on to scale to their needs while maintaining high reliability. As ERC-4337 is a nascent technology, Rundler strives to be on the bleeding edge of feature support and the team will be contributing to push the protocol forward.\n\nOur goals with Rundler:\n\nERC-4337 Specification Compliance: Rundler strives to implement the full ERC-4337 specification and to maintain support as the specification changes and new onchain components are released. This includes new Entry Point contract support, support for the upcoming P2P mempool specification, support for alternative mempools, and more.\nHigh Performance and Reliability: Rundler strives to power the most demanding workloads in cloud environments. Rust was chosen for its high performance and memory safety. Rundler's modular architecture lets providers choose to run the stateless components (RPC, builder) in a fully horizontally scalable manner connecting to the stateful components (mempool, p2p, event cache) via the network. Rundler's bundle builder is designed to be able to support the full gas throughput of the network it's building for.\nExtendability/Chain Support: ERC-4337 is designed to support any EVM chain. However, different EVM supporting networks have different rules around how they support things like gas usage, gas fees, precompiles, etc. Rundler is designed to be extendable and easily adapted to support any EVM chain.\nModularity: Rundler is written in a modular manner, allowing its components to be run as a single integrated binary, or as a distributed system. Rundler also strives for its individual crates to be used to support future ERC-4337 tooling.\n\n\nCurrently is run in Alchemy's Cloud, Coinbase's Base team, and powers >70% of UOs in Ethereum and a vast majority of UOs in the Superchain."

It transforms passive listeners into co-creators. \n\n‚ÄúMusic isn't just about sound; it's about the memories and emotions they evoke. ‚ÄòScenes‚Äô is an effort to give a tangible form to this abstract connection and capture it in something we can recognise,‚Äù shares Reddington. ‚ÄúEach song and its accompanying ‚ÄòScenes‚Äô will populate a digital gallery ‚Äì an archive that's a living testament to how music interacts with life moments in today's social media-dominated era.\"\n\nOver 300 listeners have contributed Scenes, embarking upon what fans are calling a ‚Äújourney through the rich tapestry of our inner worlds.‚Äù The BBC Radio-featured artist and web3 pioneer chooses one Scene to be each track‚Äôs primary artwork, and then all the personal moment submitted are encapsulated onchain as a digital collectables that forever links artist and listener. Scenes reaches into real world audiences and makes an emotional connection and invites them to consider what owning this digital artefact of the moment means to them (a function that only the blockchain can offer\n). The project will be displayed as an interactive physical exhibition at the Future of Music Conference and other music festivals, offering an example of how to rethink creative releases and allowing people to collect the Scenes that resonate with them in IRL as the project goes on a physical tour.\n\nScenes comprises of 6 interactive rounds where the singles are presented to the audiences pre release so that when the song and its respective gallery goes love they have already formed an emoitnal bond and contributed. For each scene of the 6 scenes a limited music NFT (the song and Gif of all submissions) is released via Manifold and a the gallery collection goes live as a Zora collection displaying and recording all audience member submissions as individual pieces of artwork. This allow for different collector profiles to connect with the project: Those who want a limited song, those who want to own their Scene and those who discover Scene that resonates with them and want to collect it.\n\n‚ÄúScenes‚Äù is Reddington‚Äôs most salient experiment to date. It builds upon a reputation based as much on championing music communities as his unique sonic signature, which blends elements of Jamie XX and Burial with found sounds like his daughter‚Äôs heartbeat.\n\nScenes aims to re-imagine the music album as an ongoing collaborative piece of performance art that explores the relationship between memories, music and our online selves to form an archive onchain of each contributors encapsulated experience.  \n\nMore about Sound of Fractures:\nJamie‚Äôs previous success, with tracks like the euphoric 'Real Friends‚Äô' and club-heavy 'Let Go, have showcased his distinctive synthesis of films, stories, and human emotions in his music. Sound of Fractures takes elements of Jamie XX and Burial and mixes it with found sounds, like his daughter‚Äôs heartbeat and day to day life to create a unique form of deeply emotional electronic music. This time, with \"Scenes\", he goes a step further, seeking to challenge the traditional album format. Instead of offering passive consumption, he sparks an active dialogue with listeners by intertwining personal stories and music. Through this new project listeners are not just passive consumers but active collaborators.  The concept of world-building is central to Jamie's vision. In an era where music has become commodified, and artist identities often diluted, Sound of Fractures offers an alternative. ‚ÄúWorld Building is forging these connections that create strong emotional bonds around an artist's music. In today's digital life, music isn't just a product; it's an entire world that fans should desire to engage with, to be part of,\" Jamie articulates.\nWith the fusion of web2 and web3, as previously seen in his 'IRL' EP, Jamie is no stranger to the frontier of the digital and physical crossovers. His exploration of how to re-think music releases has not only positioned him as a pioneer but has also showcased the potential of new technology in building artist-audience relationships without big tech gatekeepers. As Jamie succinctly puts it, \"Web3 isn't an 'or'; it's an 'and, a tool‚Äô'. A new dimension of creative freedom. It's about breaking the mold, starting new conversations, and forging genuine relationships with our fans. The future for independent artists is uncertain, but we can keep experimenting and find new approaches that bring more value to both musicians and fans\". While building a strong community across his socials by challenging the current narratives of music careers, the Scenes project offers creators a real world example of how things can be done differently. \n"

Now that one dimensional line becomes a 2D array as more folks make their own versions and then n-dimensional as Creative Version contracts are made.\n\nFunding for SEEDS goes mostly into a treasury but has not been very profitable yet.

The GitHub data is public from by Open Source Observer. The ranking and reputation compute is permissionless and verifiable, powered by OpenRank Protocol. Communities can leverage this tool to generate developer and repo reputation scores given their own seed trust. \n\nThis tool helps everyone to have a quick understanding of how the developer and repo reputation scores are generated, through the step-by-step process of selecting ranking criteria, seed trust peers, and strength of seed trust peers‚Äô opinion influencing the reputation score of the rest of the peers. \n\n[OUR IMPACT]\n\nThe web app is powered by a graph of relevant GitHub event data from Open Source Observer, covering more than 2,000 organizations and over 30,000 code repositories, was employed in generating these scores. We established two kinds of peers: GitHub users and repositories. We then used a variation of EigenTrust, the Hubs and Authorities algorithm, which computes rankings on an asymmetric bipartite trust graph. \n\nThe web app made it possible to generate client-side compute results, and replicate the same computation used in Retro 5, therefore it also serves as an educational and accountability tool for Optimism collective to better understand the governance metrics and algos used in a verifiable and transparent way. \n\n[WHAT IS OpenRank]\n\nOpenRank is a decentralized ranking and reputation protocol. It enables a verifiable reputation compute layer for the open web that unlocks a broad range of useful applications, including those that resist cryptographic or game-theoretic mechanisms of trust. Using graph compute algorithms like EigenTrust, it offers resilience from sybil contexts, provides scalable and context-specific compute, and enables permissionless access to compute and reputation data for any user."

We planned a studio session at OCF Studios here in town and had a lively session with producer & engineer wizard Cecilia. I'm really happy with how this track came out; it's like a fusion of Alternative/Hip-Hop and is laid back yet captivating.\n\nThis track and its lyrics evoke a blend of introspection, uncertainty, and a willingness to navigate through the complexities of life and relationships.\n\nBeing able to work with such a talented musician and artist like Nat Gem is something I will always be grateful for.

An encrypted mempool prevents the parts of MEV that are considered malicious (front-running, sandwich attacks) while leaving the distribution of the benign types of MEV (arbitrage, liquidations).\n\nEnd users, especially from DEXs and DEFI, benefit the most from shielded mempools. It strikes the best balance between ensuring market efficiency and minimizing malicious MEV. In other words, users enjoy a higher degree of base layer neutrality leading to a) better and fairer prices on DEXs and DeFi protocols due to front-running protection and b) an additional censorship resistance layer.\n\nAn additional benefit is that the encrypted mempool adds base layer neutrality and ensures that the sequencer's role remains impartial, making it impossible for end users or regulators to accuse the sequencer or other involved parties of market manipulation. The encryption of the mempool obscures transaction details, preventing any party from manipulating or censoring transactions based on their content. Ensuring that the transaction order is free from interference and aligns with regulatory goals of maintaining fair and transparent market practices, potentially fostering a more cooperative relationship between blockchain networks and regulatory bodies. This minimizes regulatory threats; for example, the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation MICA could treat front running and other types of MEV as ‚Äúmarket abuse‚Äù (https://twitter.com/paddi_hansen/status/1795084797238256110)\n\nShutter performed a feasibility study for Front-running protection via shielded mempool for OP Stack using threshold encryption (https://gov.optimism.io/t/shutterized-optimism-an-encrypted-mempool-for-the-op-stack/) and we are currently developing a module for the OP Stack. We are also in talks with multiple L2s, RaaS (Rollops as a Service) and shared sequencer projects to integrate mempool/transaction encryption on their solutions and integrations. They have already announced a partnership with Espresso to introduce an encrypted mempool for the Espresso sequencer network.\n\nShielded Voting. \n\nShutter protects DAO votes from manipulation by whales.

By tokenizing real-world assets and utilizing blockchain technology, the platform ensures every step in the supply chain is transparent, verifiable, and immutable.\n\nKey Features:\n\nTokenization of Assets:\n\nTokenize raw materials, components, and final products. Each token represents a real-world asset and carries information about its origin, ownership, and history.\nImmutable Records:\n\nUse blockchain to create an immutable ledger of transactions and movements of assets through the supply chain. This ensures that data cannot be altered, providing a reliable source of truth.\nEnhanced Transparency:\n\nEnable stakeholders to trace the entire journey of a product from its raw material stage to the end user. This can include details like sourcing, manufacturing processes, quality checks, and transportation.\nSmart Contracts:\n\nImplement smart contracts to automate and enforce agreements between parties. For example, payments can be automatically released once certain conditions are met, such as delivery confirmation or quality approval.\nConsumer Trust:\n\nAllow end users to verify the authenticity and history of products before purchase. This is particularly valuable for industries where product authenticity and quality are crucial, such as pharmaceuticals, luxury goods, and food.\nCompliance and Reporting:\n\nFacilitate compliance with regulatory requirements by providing transparent and auditable records. The platform can generate reports for regulatory bodies, ensuring all processes meet legal standards.\nEfficient Dispute Resolution:\n\nReduce disputes by providing clear and transparent records of transactions and asset movements. In case of a dispute, stakeholders can refer to the blockchain records to resolve issues efficiently.\nSustainability Tracking:\n\nMonitor and report on the sustainability of sourcing practices. Consumers can be assured that the products they purchase are sourced and manufactured in an environmentally friendly and ethical manner.\nIntegration with IoT:\n\nIntegrate with IoT devices to provide real-time tracking of assets. Sensors can update the blockchain with data on location, temperature, humidity, and other relevant conditions during transportation and storage.\nUser-Friendly Interface:\n\nDevelop an intuitive interface for various stakeholders, including suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, retailers, and consumers, making it easy to interact with the platform and access information."

This indicator spans various Web3 participation dimensions, unveils a range of personality types, and leverages on-chain and off-chain data, simplifying the process of growing your online presence and fostering connections, ultimately benefiting content creators and consumers alike. Rather than competing with existing SocialFi projects, we position ourselves as a complementary aid, facilitating content creators' passive growth of their social network and helping non-content creators gain the recognition they deserve for their value. We pledge to reward everyone for their unique roles and contributions to the Web3 community.\nFor more information about our project, please go to our lightpaper:\nhttps://soulcial-network.gitbook.io\n\nImpact\nWe have deployed two types of contracts on OP mainnet. One is an NFT contract based on ERC-721, and the other is for NFT trading in the project (we call it Market Contract). And we have upgraded the market contract from V1 to V3 in past few months. Therefore, we have deployed four contracts in total on OP (please check in Contracts Section). The total number of TX onchain of all 4 contracts is over 13k.\nNow we have over 10,000 users registered for the project and over 3,300 users have minted their SoulCast NFT on Optimism Mainnet. Our twitter followers are over 16k. And we have over 6800 members in our TG community. \n\nAbout Our Team\nThe core team of our project has previously worked together as colleagues at a leading blockchain company with for 5 years.

This means the token does not have any liquidity.\n\nSolution\nWe have built a honeypot token detector that performs due diligence on behalf of users to check for potential honeypot properties.\n\nThe honeypot detector forks the mainnet and queries smart contracts of AMMs for the token queried by the user. When the simulation is run, parameters like:\n\nSell tax\nBuy tax\nAmount out\nReserves\nare recorded.\n\nWe also take legacy data from the blockchain to verify if the transaction properties match. We get the pairs available for the token through Subgraphs that we have deployed and filter and simulate for pairs in question.\n\nHoneypot Detection Criteria\nA token qualifies as a honeypot if the following properties are detected:\n\nVery high sell tax\nIf the amount_out for a quoted token does not match the simulation transfers\nIf the reserves for a token pair are too low\nIf there is no token pool\nOn-Chain Security Implementation\nWe provide an Oracle that is constantly updated with the honeypot status of a token, which can be used by other contracts like lending and borrowing platforms, flash loans, and aggregators. This prevents on-chain interactions with such tokens.\n\nThis Oracle can also track tokens that are not honeypots but have a high chance of reaching a very low reserve state, enabling quick notifications to balance funds."

Our mission is to help recognize and reward the relationships the matter.\n\nLoyalty point programs have long played a role in consumer applications and businesses, supporting industries from gaming, to beauty, to food, and more. These programs encourage product usage and retention, as users are incentivized to earn points for certain behaviors and then redeem points for rewards.\n\nDespite their value, loyalty programs remain out of reach for many organizations and teams. This is due to two key problems:\n1. Cost - it's expensive and resource-intensive to setup and maintain a program of your own\n2. Value - it's hard to offer rewards alone that your users will value\n\nBlockchains help reduce the costs of creating and managing a loyalty program. Importantly, they also reduce the costs and time to execute partnerships across programs, where users can redeem points for special offers or convert them to points in another program, enabling the formation of networks of partners to share rewards with each other. \n\nBlockchains are a natural platform for points programs, with built-in accounting, security, and the promise of using smart contracts to enforce rules for redeeming points for tokens. More importantly, blockchains allow composability of points programs by enabling interoperability among providers. The same open composability that has allowed tokens to flourish will pertain to points, too. Since the points protocol runs on a public blockchain, brands can collaborate without encountering any intermediary."

Streams are the ultimate form of programmable money‚Äîcapital-efficient, composable, and capable. With streaming funding, web3 builders can make more, sustainable impact with less.\n\nOur flagship product is Streaming Quadratic Funding (SQF). SQF is a novel implementation of quadratic funding (QF), the public goods funding mechanism introduced by Vitalik Buterin, Zoe Hitzig, & Glen Weyl.\n\nAs the name suggests, SQF is QF with a streaming architecture. Donations are structured as open-ended money flows rather than one-off transfers. An incrementally updated quadratic matching formula continuously allocates pool funds based on these streamed ‚Äúvotes.‚Äù SQF can be thought of as running a full quadratic matching round every block.\n\nBut SQF isn‚Äôt just a faster QF.\n\nBy eliminating time discontinuities of the periodic round, SQF becomes something different‚Äîcreating new dynamics for grantees, donors, and outcomes while maintaining QF‚Äôs core democratic principles and effectiveness.\n\nSQF rounds can be open-ended or longer than practical for periodic rounds (with traditional QF, the matching pool is distributed only after the round ends). This shift relieves structural pressure to consolidate grantee discovery and donor/voter participation.\n\nSQF grantees don't need to compete for donor mindshare during constrained voting periods the same way and can stay focused on their core missions.\n\nThe traditional periodic round structure also asks a lot of donors/voters. It‚Äôs difficult to make informed decisions across numerous and broad rounds. With SQF, there‚Äôs an opportunity for higher signal and sustained donor-grantee relationships that evolve naturally on the donor‚Äôs timeline.\n\nSQF‚Äôs continuous model also provides more funding predictability for grantees. Funds streamed through an SQF pool immediately hit the grantee‚Äôs account with incremental shifts in receipts.\n\nWe've seen these advantages play out in our first partner round sponsored by Octant. In the 150+ days since we launched the round for graduates of Octant's Accelerator Program, we've allocated over 26 ETH to the builders. Multiple teams have indicated that SQF funding has sustained them through the launch of their products."

The entire painting bursts with energy and childlike imagination, showing a world through the eyes of a young artist, where both her father and summer hold a special place."

It has been empowering developers with a crypto-native financial primitive, money streaming, and a modular smart contracts framework to build applications that leverage a formula-based balance and gasless, liquid, ongoing value transfer.\n\nOver 49,394 streams have been started on Optimism and 644,584 on Base for a combined total volume of over $280M.\n\nSuperfluid is designed to minimize its TVL in favor of making assets available to sender or recipient at all times, minimizing funds locked in smart contracts. As such its impact is better measures in total volume transferred, number of total or active streams, total number of users and daily active users. When measuring the protocol activity it's important to not only rely on the on-chain transaction to smart contracts, but also on the the inner mechanics of the protocol (i.e. by evaluating the actions triggered via callData or by using the protocol subgraph).\n\nOn the alignment with Optimism and Retro Funding\n- Superfluid is builder-centric. A developer tool with clear focus on onboarding more developers to build more apps. As such, it‚Äôs additive to Optimism‚Äôs own goals.\n- Superfluid is supporting long term, real world use cases, like Salaries, Subscriptions, Memberships, Rentals, Airdrops, Grants distribution as well as entirely novel applications in DeFi, SocialFi and beyond.\n\nSuperfluid Protocol has been used by the Optimism Foundation to stream the RPGF3 & RF4 grants, and will be used again in the upcoming rounds, providing the rails for a seamless funds distribution.\n\nThe protocol has been designed around builders and developers, with a set of tools available for building, debugging and data retrieval that empower new applications development. Here you can see an overview of projects built on Superfluid that have added value (and usage) to the Optimism and Base networks: https://www.superfluid.finance/post/how-superfluid-protocol-is-empowering-onchain-builders\n\nIf you have any questions or would like to learn more about Superfluid, please reach out to mdali.eth on Warpcast or Twitter/X."

The mint is currently in progress on Foundation, but we couldn't modify the mint price and ETH has doubled in price since the start of our project, so this collection was doomed to fail. However, thanks to Base, we have built an incredible community with over 8k followers on Warpcast. We have made incredible connections and set up a subscription on Hypersub, which allows our collectors to subscribe for 1 or several months. Each month, our subscribers receive 1 drop of a City per day. Our artistic project has come back to life, and our community is growing day by day to reveal this magnificent collection."

    "description": "Build on KATANA (POL & GSR De-fi chain)\n\nFounded in October 2023, Tea-Fi was built with a clear mission: to simplify and open up decentralized finance through an accessible, opportunity-driven ecosystem. Positioned at the intersection of usability and real-world utility, Tea-Fi enables users to participate in DeFi across networks, strategies, and risk levels‚Äîall through a unified, efficient platform. It‚Äôs not just about connecting wallets to protocols; it‚Äôs about creating a structured environment where value, control, and growth are accessible to users at every level.\nRather than building isolated products, Tea-Fi was architected as a multi-layered system:\nA modular vault infrastructure, enabling exposure to curated real yield opportunities\nSeamless cross-chain interaction and asset movement\nOn- and off-ramp integration for frictionless entry and exit\nA native token economy that ties protocol success to user alignment\nThis architecture is supported by active protocol development, a growing network of strategic partnerships, and a long-term roadmap that includes lending markets, restaking mechanisms, index-based yield products, and more.\nAt the foundation of Tea-Fi‚Äôs design are three core values that guide both product development and ecosystem direction:\nOpportunities\n Tea-Fi is committed to delivering authentic, sustainable financial opportunities that reflect real market activity. Strategies are designed to accommodate a variety of user profiles‚Äîacross chains, risk appetites, and time horizons‚Äîwhile maximizing efficiency and minimizing friction.\nSimplicity\n In a sector known for complexity, Tea-Fi removes barriers. From intuitive UI/UX to features like Easy-Gas and unified transaction flows, the platform is structured to support seamless user journeys‚Äîfrom first deposit to advanced strategy participation.\nEcosystem Collaboration\n Tea-Fi believes in building with the ecosystem, not outside it. Whether through deployment of Tea-Fi modules on third-party platforms, aggregation of external DeFi products, or infrastructure-based collaborations, Tea-Fi is positioned as a hub‚Äînot a silo‚Äîwithin the decentralized economy.\nTogether, these pillars support a clear vision: to grow responsibly, integrate meaningfully, and deliver long-term value for users, partners, and the broader DeFi landscape.\n\nin addition - Tea-Fi offers high APY managed Yeild Vaults (for further explanation - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kHJ0HTVVUDzFqrqLdJDs6dQGTbQHe3kIVd2QrFNah3s/edit?tab=t.0 )\n\nAt the heart of Tea-Fi‚Äôs economic architecture lies the TeaPot Vault‚ÄîTea-Fi‚Äôs protocol-owned liquidity layer, and a direct reflection of the protocol‚Äôs long-term alignment with its users. This vault is identical in structure and operating principles to the same vaults offered to users on the platform. Rather than simply promoting yield strategies externally, Tea-Fi commits its own capital under the exact same conditions‚Äîdemonstrating full confidence in the system it has built.\nPerformance fees, swap revenues, and future service-based earnings are directed into the TeaPot Vault. These funds are never withdrawn. Instead, only the yield generated from these assets is utilized‚Äîprimarily for TEA token buybacks and strategic ecosystem incentives. This structure creates a self-reinforcing flywheel: capital enters once, and its yield continues to deliver value to the protocol and its users over time.\nBy locking protocol revenue into its own vault, Tea-Fi transforms earnings into productive, yield-bearing capital, reinforcing both the protocol‚Äôs credibility and the durability of its economic model. This design is not just symbolic‚Äîit‚Äôs structural: revenues aren‚Äôt extracted or cycled back through short-term incentives, but are retained within the protocol, where they continue generating sustainable returns.\nThis approach protects long-term Total Value Locked (TVL) by anchoring a base layer of capital within the system itself. It also enables Tea-Fi to offer high APYs without relying on inflationary token emissions, since rewards are powered by real yield from deployed assets‚Äînot synthetic incentives. Over time, the TeaPot Vault becomes a growing source of long-term liquidity, tied directly to the protocol‚Äôs overall economic success\n\nBlurb and protocol data (USERS, TVL and more):\nDUNE - https://dune.com/spaceharpoon/teafi-protocol\nDappRadar - https://dappradar.com/dapp/tea-fi\n\n‚òïÔ∏è Tea-Fi (http://Tea-fi.com/) - Turning Complexity Into Opportunity\n\nüõ© Mission \nTea-Fi is taking the Hustle out of DeFi with a seamless, intuitive & unified SUPER APP that integrates financial tools and aggregated infrastructure, eliminating the hassle of crypto management.\n\nüì£ Achievements & Backers\n‚ùï$ 5.5 M Raised\n‚ùï$ 47 M Investment Commitment\n‚ùïBacked by Polygon Labs & Castrum Capital\n‚ùïTop-3 dApp on Polygon\n\nüìà Platform Stats\n- 3.4M wallets connected‚ÄÉ\n- 130K off-chain DAU‚ÄÉ\n- 100K on-chain MAU\n- $530M+ volume‚ÄÉ\n- 17M On-Chain transactions\n\nüé© KOLs & Ambassadors \nRan Neuner, Skywee, Andres, Crypto Banter, Ivan on Tech + 100 more\n\nü§ù Partners \nPolygon, QuickSwap, CoinGecko, Orbs, 1inch, ChainLink, Binance Wallet, Unstoppable Domains, Halborn, Chainalysis, LiFi, Cookie3, Efficient Frontier + 50 others\n\n‚úçÔ∏è Security \n19 audits (Cyber Scope & Halborn)\nMPC with Utila \n$ 1.1 M bug-bounty (Cantina & Immunefi)\n\nüíª Products \n‚òïÔ∏èSuperSwap ‚òïÔ∏èEasy-Gas ‚òïÔ∏èYield Engine ‚òïÔ∏è Privacy Layer ‚òïÔ∏èCustomisable Dashboards ‚òïÔ∏èTeaCard (Mastercard)\n\nOfficial links & docs (https://linktr.ee/Tea_Fi)"

    "description": "The Book of Optimism Fault Proof\n\nThe Book of Optimism Fault Proof repository is a resource aimed at demystifying the fault proof system for newcomers and seasoned developers alike. Centered around the transformative concept of a fault proof system, this project shifts away from centralized proposers to a mechanism grounded in game theory. The purpose of this document is to offer a multifaceted explanation of the fault proof system, providing newcomers with a rapid understanding of its mechanics and the specific details of its code.\n\n1. Starting with the Basics\n\nThe journey into understanding fault proof begins with the simplest design of such a system. This approach breaks down the complexity of fault proof into manageable parts, making it easier for newcomers to grasp the fundamental concepts and how they interconnect within the broader system architecture.\n\n2. Key Components Explained\n\nFault Proof: At its core, the fault proof mechanism replaces centralized proposer systems, which are susceptible to biases and inefficiencies, with a decentralized, game-theory-based approach.\nFault Proof Game: This component employs a binary search technique to pinpoint and verify discrepancies between parties on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and fairness in dispute resolution.\nCannon: An off-chain program, Cannon is pivotal in generating verifiable data needed for on-chain interactions, bridging the gap between theoretical fault proof and practical implementation.\nop-program: This tool provides the necessary prototype files for Cannon, facilitating services for pre-image data crucial for the system‚Äôs operations.\nop-challenger: Automating the gameplay elements of the fault proof system, op-challenger utilizes both Cannon and op-program to streamline processes and enhance system integrity.\n\n3. Architecture Mechanics\n\nUnderstanding the architecture of the fault proof system involves exploring how these components work together to form a robust mechanism. From the deployment of smart contracts and proxies on the Ethereum blockchain, identified by specific addresses such as MIPS and DisputeGameFactoryProxy, to the integration of off-chain computations with on-chain verifications, the architecture is designed for scalability and security.\n\n4. Comprehensive Resources\n\nFurther enriching this document, an extensive collection of articles and videos is summarized, providing deep dives into each component and the fault proof mechanism as a whole. These resources are meticulously curated to extend learning beyond the initial explanations, offering insights into potential applications and optimizations of the fault proof system.\n\n5. For Newcomers and Experts\n\nWhether you are a new entrant eager to understand the basics or an expert looking to refine your knowledge of decentralized systems, the repository offers a wealth of information designed to bring all readers up to speed on the innovative fault proof system.\n"

Maintained by OpenZeppelin, each level provides a gamified experience where a smart contract must be ‚Äòhacked‚Äô to progress. It is 100% open-source, with all levels contributed by players.\n\nIn 2024, we have continued expanding the game, adding four new advanced levels‚ÄîHigherOrder, Stake, Impersonator, and Magic Animal Carousel‚Äîwhich explore current vulnerabilities in smart contract development. These levels introduce challenges related to low-level EVM programming, staking vulnerabilities, signature verification exploits, and bitwise manipulation attacks, pushing players to deepen their understanding of Ethereum security.\n\nBeyond new levels, we have also redesigned the UI, added support for multiple networks, and expanded language translations to make the game more accessible to a global audience.\n\nWe believe that The Ethernaut is an essential training tool for developers across the Ethereum ecosystem, including those building on the Optimism network. By continually evolving the game with new challenges and features, we strive to make smart contract security education engaging, practical, and accessible to everyone."

Each week, a snapshot captures the amount of opxVELO in each pool, and the pool receives one vote for each opxVELO pooled. It has achieved its success without subsidy, grants, or outside funding.

    "description": "What is Sound Ecos?\n\nMy name is Malik Naim, I am a creative who's most passionate mediums are sound and pen. When I began exploring blockchain technology for my art, my goal was to create a more immersive experience for my fans. I wanted to forge a deeper connection with my audience beyond traditional means, leading to the creation of the Soundverse. This journey began in 2021 with Rap Pack NFTs, where I offered streaming royalties in exchange for holding my music NFTs. While this was a fruitful start, I aimed to dive deeper than merely sharing streaming royalties.\n\nI envisioned a storybook world governed entirely by sound, which led to the development of multiple Music NFT PFP collectibles. These offered rewards such as custom songs, chapter features within the Soundverse story, and various interactive opportunities. As I expanded this world, I focused on building the lore around my original holders and engaged new fans.\n\nI released singles as open editions on Ethereum and Polygon. Discovering Sound XYZ allowed me to launch songs on the Optimism (OP) chain. Throughout 2022, I distributed NFTs through email signups and other messaging methods, onboarding new and existing investors to OP. Influencers from East Asia supported my releases due to the low entry price, ensuring that anyone, regardless of their financial situation, could hold my music. This inclusive approach was well-received by my community.\n\nWorking with P00ls, I developed Sound Coin, which now has 13,000 holders across various L2 chains. My broader vision involves transitioning these Polygon holders to the OP chain with Sound Gold ($SGLD), the main currency for exclusive and immersive experiences. Both tokens offer redeemable content and services, with significant potential for interactivity.\n\nOn the BASE network, I released Based Sound ($BSOUND), an active liquidity and educational token. Buying $BSOUND grants a music meme NFT on BASE, with staking options to earn music NFTs from my Based Music collection. The goal is to create a user-friendly interface that connects me with my fans in an intimate way.\n\nAdditionally, I am developing a simple game initially available to beta testers (my top holders) before a wider release on web2 and web3. The game, featuring crypto, music, and popular trends, will integrate blockchain technology, allowing players to earn Sound Coin and Sound Gold based on their performance. This game will strengthen my ecosystem and benefit the blockchain as a whole.\n\nBenefits of the Soundverse Ecosystem:\n\n\t1.\tSound Gold:\n\t‚Ä¢\tAttracts my existing community and new users interested in music-related utility products on the OP chain.\n\t‚Ä¢\tFosters consistent interactions and utility through my frequent music and content releases.\n\t‚Ä¢\tAttracts high-level investors to the OP chain once the proof of concept is established.\n\t2.\tWeb3 Integrated Game:\n\t‚Ä¢\tAppeals to music fans, gamers, and P2E crypto users, exposing more ETH-based users to the OP chain.\n\t‚Ä¢\tGenerates cash flow through in-game ads, with a portion used to add liquidity to Sound Gold and Sound Coin.\n\t‚Ä¢\tFeatures my music catalog during gameplay, enhancing my brand.\n\t‚Ä¢\tReleases a Music NFT PFP collection on OP, with traits that provide gameplay rewards.\n\t3.\tSound Coin (Polygon):\n\t‚Ä¢\tFacilitates the onboarding of Polygon holders to OP, leveraging over 300,000 interactions and weekly earnings.\n\nThe Sound Ecos is continuously evolving. I am proud of the progress and believe the Soundverse Ecosystem can serve as a blueprint for other artists seeking to build their identity and foster greater interactions. If awarded a grant, I would use the funds for further development, initial liquidity for Sound Gold, and additional marketing, promotion, and mint rewards.\n\nI aim to keep the game and coin integration simple, providing a low-risk environment for users to enjoy the blockchain while engaging with my music. Consistent releases on OP/BASE/ZORA and other L2s will remain a cornerstone of my growing ecosystem."

ERC404 tokens embrace characteristics of both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens: They are ‚Äúsemi-fungible,‚Äù enabling both highly liquid markets and uniqueness within a single asset. This allows collectors to sell their tokens when they want and in pieces, if they‚Äôd like, as well as introduces the ability to reroll your NFT traits by making more transactions. ERC404s are inherently fractionalized and designed to work natively with existing DeFi protocols. While innovative, it‚Äôs important to note that ERC404 is also experimental.\n\nWhen we first launched $TRASH, we forked Pandora‚Äôs contract and raced to be one of the first, if not the first project to deploy an ERC404 on Base. Pandora‚Äôs contract was limited to 5 variations of artwork, images that implied a reveal down the line, so we followed suit with 5 closed-lid NFTs of different rarities. Our next goal was to have a PFP collection with the lids removed, so we came up with the idea to create a new contract where you could stash your $TRASH and mint a Dumpster Diver. This contract is named The Dumpster. It is open source and available to any other ERC404 token that wishes to fork it to enable their holders to redeem their ERC404 token for an ERC721.\n\nIn addition to the ability to mint an ERC721 by depositing an ERC404, the Dumpster contract enables holders of Dumpster Divers PFP tokens to burn their ERC721 to redeem the original ERC404 that the ERC721 was minted with (retaining the rarity and token ID). A small cleaning fee (0.00042069 ETH, updatable by governance) is charged, and this mechanism can also be used for regenerating/rerolling or ‚Äòrecycling‚Äô, Dumpster Diver PFPs to get the desired traits.\n\nWe have grown to 185 holders and have generated $44k from trade fees (50% of which is $TRASH and 100% of which is reinvested in providing liquidity for our pools), and 1,654,148 DEGEN (~$40k) from liquidity mining rewards. We were also a finalist in the Backdrop Build V3 Accelerator Program (top 5% of applicants). \n\nTrash NFTs have built an effective machine: by owning the LPs that facilitate the swaps into $TRASH we capture 1% of the volume and store that in our treasury. We have two liquidity pools: 1) TRASH/ETH and 2) TRASH/ DEGEN, the rapidly growing meme token with utility in the Farcaster network and beyond. This exposes Trash NFTs to volatility, which generates more revenue because arbitrage bots stabilize the price across pools. \n\nTrash NFTs is also governed by a DAO called Waste Management that was initially allocated 20% of all $TRASH tokens. This DAO collects the cleaning fees associated with trait rerolls as well as the transaction fees and LP rewards from its DeFi activities. Finally, Trash NFTs has entered the meatspace by hosting a trash pickup event during Farcon 2024 with /humankind. \n\nWe are proud of Trash NFTs, as it has maintained and proven to be a sound investment for its holder base while operating successfully. There are definite improvements we continue working toward: 1) expanding growth efforts to the broader 404 ecosystem with partnerships (such as Scattering.io with which we have built a relationship) and promotion, 2) revamping The Dumpster website for a more seamless experience and 3) engaging the community to take leadership in expanding the DAO."

    "description": "Who We Are\n\nTribuni was born out of the ETH Denver hackathon, spearheaded by a team of decentralized governance practitioners. Our founding members include delegates from Blockchain@USC actively participating in Optimism's governance. With expertise spanning software engineering, product design, and product management across both Web2 and crypto landscapes, our diverse team is dedicated to enhancing the delegate experience.\n\nOur Story\n\nBeing a delegate requires constantly staying up-to-date due to the sheer volume of information that needs to be digested. Before Tribuni, we experienced firsthand the challenges of managing extensive data and keeping track of vital governance activities. To address this pain point, we engaged with a wide range of delegates from groups such as 404DAO, Brichis, PGov, Launamu, FranklinDAO, etc. Their insights and feedback inspired us to build a tool tailored specifically for delegates like them.\n\nOur Solution\n\nDelegates are the cornerstone of Optimism's governance system. Active and well-informed delegates lead to resilient and sound governance. However, delegates need to process a lot of information and often find it challenging to stay up-to-date. We are humans after all.\n\nTo help delegates stay active and well-informed, our team launched Tribuni‚Äîa free Telegram mini-app built exclusively for delegates. Tribuni sends quality AI-generated proposal summaries, vote reminders, and OP forum activity digests directly via Telegram. This ensures that delegates never miss a vote or an important discussion within the OP ecosystem, as long as they're connected to Telegram.\n\nImpact\n\nAs of September 2024, Tribuni proudly supports 28 OP delegate profiles, encompassing a staggering 28,217,127 votes combined. This substantial vote power not only surpasses Optimism's 26 million quorum but also underscores Tribuni's pivotal role in the governance ecosystem. Our platform serves 38 dedicated Optimism subscribers, including influential entities like PGOV, blockchain@USC, 404DAO, PGov, Gauntlet, Tane Gov, etc who manage multiple delegate memberships. Through Tribuni, we help them analyzed 1,113 posts across 186 forum topics, ensuring they remain well-informed and proactive in decision-making. By seamlessly integrating into their workflows, Tribuni has become an indispensable tool, empowering delegates to govern more effectively and maintain the resilience of Optimism's governance structure."

As a tool for private payments, Umbra is especially useful on an L2 network like Optimism, where low fees make the payments use case more tenable than mainnet. Umbra also launched on Base in April 2024.\n\nScopeLift, the creators of Umbra, have also contributed to several EIPs to help standardize stealth addresses for all EVM networks.

We have worked collaboratively with the Optimism Foundation to provide a toolkit to measure VBE in both the Citizens House and Token House to study their levels of decentralization. We have also released a public dashboard measuring VBE across DAOs. (Optimism Collective, as it turns out, ranks #1, i.e., has the highest VBE.)\n\nWe can't build truly equitable and durable DAOs unless we understand the meaning of the 'D' in DAO‚Äîthe decentralization part‚Äîand can measure it. Existing metrics‚Äîthe Nakamoto coefficient, the Gini coefficient, etc.‚Äîhave a number of shortcomings. We have proposed a new metric, called voting-block entropy (VBE)‚Äîpronounced \"vibe.\" It measures decentralization in a principled way that avoids the pitfalls of previous metrics and better reflects intuitive notions of decentralization, such as diversity of opinions, credible neutrality, etc.\n\nVBE additionally offers practical guidance for DAO administrators and users. Using VBE as a theoretical foundation, we have proven a number of basic theorems about ways to increase VBE and thus improve decentralization. \n\nOur work on VBE has involved strong collaboration with the Optimism Foundation (OF). In consultation with the OF, we have developed tools for the OF (and other projects) for measuring VBE. We have shared the resulting code for the Optimism-specific VBE toolkit with the Optimism Foundation for their use in analysis of the Optimism DAOs. We have also created a public dashboard at https://tinyurl.com/y2ftwavu that includes up-to-date VBE measurements for a number of major DAOs in the ecosystem. (Optimism, as it turns out, is currently #1, i.e., exhibits the highest VBE.)\n\nOur team consists of researchers associated with Ari Juels's group at Cornell Tech."

    "description": "WAVE was the inaugural drop of N3XTWAVE Collective, which I initiated and organized in September last year. The theme for this drop was discussed collectively, with ‚ÄòWAVE‚Äô theme proposed by Francoise Gamma, strongly inspired by our collective's name. ‚ÄòWAVE‚Äô, representing an impactful force, seemed perfect for a collective drop as it symbolizes our coming together for a simultaneous mint. It also conveys the idea of constant motion, which reflects the ever-evolving Web3 and NFT markets that we actively shape every day.\nGiven its multiple meanings, we decided to keep the theme open to interpretation for each artist. Each member of the collective created their own ‚ÄòWAVE‚Äô - some more literal, others more metaphorical or abstract - each in their personal artistic style and chosen technique. As a result, we have built a collection that is stylistically diverse, ranging from minimalistic and linear to pixelated and glitch aesthetics, making it versatile and appealing to a wide range of tastes. \nSince collaborative contracts were not available on Zora at that time, this drop functions as a collection tied together by a shared art statement that I wrote, which is included in the description of each mint. Here it is:\n‚ÄøÔ∏µ‚ÄøÔ∏µ‚ÄøÔ∏µ\nWAVE reflects the essence of our collective, signifying our unity through a synchronized mint.\nWAVE embodies a powerful force, representing our aspirations as a fresh and influential art group to make a significant impact on the current art scene.\nWAVE signifies perpetual motion, mirroring the ever-evolving landscape of Web3 that we actively shape everyday.\nEach WAVE mint from N3XTWAVE Collective is a ripple sparking waves of inspiration and creativity, expanding the horizons of artistic expression.\nJoin us in making waves by minting the WAVE Drop!\n‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† About N3XTWAVE:‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† N3XTWAVE is an art collective started by artist bleu281 in June 2023. He brought together a small group of visual artists of various generations, styles, backgrounds, and nationalities, yet all based in Europe. United by our exploration of the digital medium, we all experiment with pixels through modern and abandoned digital techniques. \nAs of today, N3XTWAVE consists of 17 members from countries including: France, Germany, Poland, Spain, Italy, the UK, Ireland, and the Czech Republic. \n‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† \nFull details & credits of the WAVE drop: ‚óÜ Initiative, Organizing & Art Statement: V5MT ‚óÜ Promo - Animated Flyers: V5MT ‚óÜ WAVE theme suggestion: Francoise Gamma ‚óÜ N3XTWAVE Animated Logos: Francoise Gamma ‚óÜ PR: V5MT, Ugo Digi ‚óÜ Release Date: September 18th 2023 ‚óÜ Platform: zora.co ‚óÜ Network: ZORA ‚óÜ Artists: Ugo Digi, Bleu281, V5MT, Danctrl, Francoise Gamma, Datura, Lucas Lejeune, mostwrongking, Nicholas Dietrich,  k0ch, Element Lee.\n‚îÄ‚îÄ‚¨•‚îÄ‚îÄ \nNotes: \n‚¨•I'm submitting this project from my personal Farcaster account, not N3XTWAVE, which I also set up, but didn't have time to manage.‚¨• Because Zora had no collaborative contracts at the time of the drop, I'm linking to my Mirror article with all the minted pieces embedded, instead of to Zora. + I also included a link to the 'WAVE Drop Organizing' essay I released on Mirror, where I describe the process of organizing this project in detail.‚¨•I plan to share the potential reward from this submission and distribute it to the artists accordingly."

    "description": "Webhash.com is a no-code platform designed to empower users to create tokenised, decentralised, and permanent websites seamlessly. Targeting both ENS (Ethereum Name Service) and traditional DNS domains, users can build and deploy robust websites without any coding knowledge, ensuring their web presence is tamper-proof and enduring. These websites are deployed on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and tokenised on Base, providing enhanced security, immutability, and ownership verification, setting a new standard in website development and management.\n\nTokenisation: Each website created on Webhash.com is tokenised on the Base blockchain. This means that every website is represented by a unique token, ensuring clear ownership and provenance. Tokenisation allows for easy transfer and trading of website ownership, creating a seamless and secure way to manage web properties.\n\nDecentralisation: By deploying websites on IPFS, Webhash.com leverages a distributed network of nodes to store and serve content. This decentralised approach eliminates single points of failure, making websites more resilient to censorship and server outages. It ensures that the content remains accessible as long as the network exists, without relying on any central authority.\n\nPermanence: The combination of IPFS and Filecoin ensures that websites are permanent and immutable. Once content is added to IPFS, it is distributed across multiple nodes, making it tamper-proof. Our smart contract on base provides an immutable ledger of ownership and changes, guaranteeing that once a website is created and tokenised, its history and content cannot be altered or erased.\n\nPermanence: The combination of IPFS and Filecoin ensures that websites are permanent and immutable.

This integration means every decentralised website created on Webhash is automatically generated with a .limo extension, ensuring a uniform and recognizable domain system for users and visitors alike. Furthermore, all content created on Webhash is pinned on Eth.limo's IPFS node, which not only enhances the reliability and speed of content delivery but also strengthens the decentralised nature of our hosting solutions.\n\nOur collaboration with Eth.limo is further enhanced through the integration of Eth.limo's API, including their Domain over HTTPS (DoH) API, into the Webhash ENS website resolver (browser extension). This advanced integration leverages @ethlimo.eth‚Äôs DoH API to efficiently fetch the corresponding IPFS hash or Arweave link associated with a .eth domain. This capability streamlines the process of linking ENS domains to their corresponding decentralised content, ensuring a seamless and efficient resolution system for decentralised web access. \n\nüåç Namespace: With the integration of Namespace, users can mint subdomains directly on Webhash, offering a layer of personalization and organisation to their decentralised web presence. These subdomains provide a scalable way for users to categorise, manage, and deploy multiple decentralised websites under a unified domain structure, further enriching the Webhash ecosystem.\n\nüîÑ Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP): In an exciting development, we're implementing a new feature that allows users to showcase their Ethereum Follow Protocol (EFP) numbers directly on their decentralised websites. This block, when added to a site on Webhash, not only highlights the user's engagement within the Ethereum community but also fosters a sense of connectivity and social proof among decentralised web participants. The Ethereum Follow Protocol integration signifies our commitment to leveraging blockchain technology not just for hosting but also for community building and engagement.\n\nüî® Community Engagement through Buildathons: Our mission to ignite active participation within the ENS community has led to the creation of decentralised websites for ENS domains through Webhash. Our Buildathons, including collaborations like frENS, are key to empowering individuals to develop innovative decentralised digital identities.\n\nBuildathon 1: We gave $1000 to five winners who build decentralised websites\nBuildathon 2: Done in collaboration with frENS. We gave $1000 to five winners who build decentralised websites.\nBuildathon 3: Still in progress we a giving $1200 to five winners\n\n\nKey features of Webhash: \n\nNo-Code Interface: We've created a no-code, user-friendly interface that makes building decentralised websites accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise.\nVersatile Content Creation & Integration: Our platform at Webhash enriches the ENS domain experience by enabling users to create a broad spectrum of content types with seamless integrations. We have designed a user-friendly interface that allows for the addition of various standard elements such as avatars with diverse styles, engaging headings, informative paragraphs, and external links, all of which enhance the user's webpage. The integration capabilities of our platform include a suite of options that cater to different media types and functionalities:\n\nSocial Media Integration: Users can showcase their social presence with icons linked to their profiles on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and more, fostering engagement directly from their ENS dwebsite.\n\nMultimedia Content: Embedding capabilities for platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Spotify, and SoundCloud allow users to share a wide range of audiovisual content, from music tracks and podcasts to videos and livestreams.\n\nWeb3 activity blocks: Integrated key web3 projects like Farcaster and POAP so that users can showcase their web3 activity. \n\nInteractive Features: Inclusion of interactive elements such as image sliders, RSS feeds, countdown widgets, and forms elevates the user experience by engaging visitors with dynamic content.\nContent Distribution: Our platform supports file sharing directly from the page, whether it‚Äôs audio files, PDF documents, or any downloadable content, making it a versatile tool for content distribution.\nCommunication and Sharing: Integration of communication tools like Discord servers and call-to-action prompts encourages community building and interaction. Additionally, our VCard feature enables users to share contact information in a professional manner.\n\nMonetization: We've integrated payment solutions like PayPal, enabling users to collect payments for products, services, or donations directly through their ENS decentralised website.\n\nCustomization: Advanced customization with custom HTML/CSS/JS and Markdown formatting allows for unique content creation. \n\nCredibility and Engagement: By adding customer reviews and FAQs, users can build credibility and provide valuable information to their audience.\n\nThe combination of these features on the Webhash platform not only empowers users to create comprehensive 'link-in-bio' pages but also extends to more complex decentralised website formats such as blogs, portfolios, and business landing pages.

    "description": "Xottle: Tokenized Bottle Waste Platform addresses the pressing issue of plastic waste by creating a system that encourages and rewards recycling.\nHere's how Xottle makes a difference:\n\n1. Incentivizing Recycling\nPeople often lack motivation to recycle due to the absence of immediate rewards. Xottle solves this by rewarding users with $XOTL tokens for every bottle they recycle. These tokens can be used to purchase merchandise or access exclusive benefits, turning recycling into a rewarding activity.\n\n2. Transparency and Trust\nTraditional recycling programs can be opaque, leading to mistrust. Xottle leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, recording every recycled bottle and transaction on the blockchain. This provides users with verifiable proof that their recycling efforts are contributing positively to the environment.\n\n3. Gamifying the Experience\nRecycling is often seen as mundane, which can lead to disengagement. Xottle makes recycling engaging through challenges and leaderboards, where users can earn badges and compete to see who can recycle the most. This gamification keeps users motivated and involved.\n\n4. Simplifying the Process\nThe complexity of recycling can deter participation. Xottle simplifies this by allowing users to scan a QR code on each bottle, instantly registering their recycling and earning rewards. This makes recycling as easy as scanning a code, lowering the barrier to participation.\n\nSummary\nXottle is a platform that combines financial incentives, gamification, and blockchain transparency to make recycling easier, more engaging, and rewarding.

    "description": "2023 was a challenging year for everyone in the crypto space, from developers and artists to investors and airdrop hunters.\n\nIn response, I created a new collection called \"YAMI,\" meaning \"darkness\" in Japanese. It reflected my mood at the time: not entirely bright, with parts of my mind dark enough to cause pain. However, we had to endure the winter to reach the delightful summer. This collection symbolizes our collective struggle and hope to overcome adversity and emerge stronger and brighter.\n\nThe collection comprises 2023 pieces of generative art, mirroring the year of its creation. While it wasn't a free-mint collection, many generous art lovers minted the pieces. It wasn't just about the art; it was about communication, community, and the broader economy within the network.\n\nI collaborated with the LEX Labs team for this collection, so I didn't deploy the contract myself. LEX Labs, a skilled team of developers managing an NFT community, assisted with image generation, contract deployment, and more.\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/yamiofficial/\n\nI've been an NFT artist since 2022, primarily focusing on Layer 2 solutions. My second collection, \"TOMO,\" consisting of 10k pieces, was on the Optimism network and minted out quickly within 24 hours.\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/tomonft\n\nFollowing TOMO, I achieved great success with an open-edition art piece in collaboration with Coinbase and Manifold. Titled \"Optimistic Handstand,\" this open-edition piece on the Optimism network saw over 20k pieces minted.\nhttps://app.manifold.xyz/c/OptimisticHandstand\n\nDespite the bear market conditions, I continue to create art. I've ventured into animated illustrations as well. Here are some of my passionately created animated pieces:\n\nNAYAMI: A free-mint collection on Optimism for YAMI purchasers.\nhttps://opensea.io/collection/nayami/\n\nIKERU: A paid-mint collection on Base.\nhttps://app.manifold.xyz/c/ikeru\n\nBlobz!: A free-mint collection on Zora.\nhttps://zora.co/collect/zora:0x90cf58c7991e47bfa4a4e8497a751ac0b7f4d1d4/1"

It runs daily balance snapshots, aggregates yield data at both token and protocol level, and presents it through an intuitive and interactive dashboard. Yecho currently supports leading protocols such as Aave, Compound, Spark, Venus, Fluid, YieldFi, Hyperlend, and Felix, with new integrations added regularly across EVM-compatible chains.\n\nHow it works\nGetting started with Yecho is straightforward: users connect any EVM-compatible wallet to their dashboard, and Yecho automatically detects active DeFi positions within supported protocols. Each day, the platform takes a complete on-chain snapshot of positions, lending deposits balances. This process is fully automated no manual data entry is required. The snapshot data is stored securely and preserved over time, enabling users to revisit historical performance.\n\nOnce collected, the data is processed to calculate daily gains, track cumulative yields, and identify trends. Users can explore this information via interactive charts, compare performance across protocols, and analyze changes over time. By consolidating yield data from multiple chains into a single, user-friendly interface, Yecho makes it easier to understand portfolio performance and refine investment strategies.\n\nBehind the scenes, a dedicated snapshot script runs on a secure server, using ethers.js to query smart contracts directly via RPC calls. To improve efficiency and minimize network load, Yecho leverages Multicall requests, allowing multiple balance queries to be bundled into a single RPC call. This architecture ensures accurate, up-to-date analytics while remaining scalable for a growing user base.\n\nBy combining blockchain integrations, automated yield tracking, and in-depth analytics, Yecho offers DeFi participants a powerful tool to monitor and optimize their earnings across multiple ecosystems in one place."

    "description": "Hi, I‚Äôm Yusei, the founder of Reflect (formerly Grand Base). Back in 2023, I launched the first native RWA synthetic app on Base, attracting over 1,000 testnet users and bringing significant activity to the chain with the $GB listed on Aerodrome, I played a role in democratizing its incentive mechanisms, back when Aerodrome was barely hitting $2-5M in weekly volume. For months the token generated millions in weekly volume and helped distribute hundreds of thousands of dollars in incentives to both Base enjoyers and Aerodrome users.\n\nIn April 2024, I faced a devastating hack, putting everything down and at risk. I decided to rebuild from scratch, with a self-funded approach. That‚Äôs how Reflect was born, a protocol dedicated to developing AI-powered execution layers for DeFi.\n\nI'm building specialized agents, starting with the Dromes (Aero and Velo). Flight Fren, is an agent that allows users to swap, add liquidity, vote, lock tokens, and track onchain data effortlessly all through natural language commands.\n\nFlight Fren is here to transform how users interact with DeFi:\n-Onchain Investment insights \n- Market trend analysis & automated execution\n-Yield strategy optimization\n-Simplified onchain data for better decision-making\n- And my end goal is, automated liquidity management\n\nAs the Optimism Superchain expands, Velodrome is becoming the ultimate liquidity hub, bridging liquidity across multiple L2s, and with Reflect, I'm naturally positioning it to grow alongside the SC.\nThis means Flight Fren will scale beyond Aerodrome, integrating Velodrome to bring cross-chain AI execution to liquidity management, yield farming, and automated trading across multiple L2s.\n\nI'm also buidling the Reflecticons. The First Super NFT Collection on Base & the Superchain, an AIGC and upgradable NFT collection, developed in partnership with ORA. This collection is about AIGC and also will open doors to the first Super NFT bridge for the superchain.\n\n- Verifiable AI minting with ERC-7007 technology\n- Upgradeable NFTs that evolve over time\n- Super NFT, transferable inside the Superchain.\n\nUseful links\nhttps://linktr.ee/RFLOnBase\nhttps://reflect.now/\nhttps://chat.reflect.now\nhttps://docs.reflect.now"

    "description": "ZKP2P is a decentralized on/off-ramp built using zero-knowledge proofs that allow users to on-ramp to crypto using every day payment apps (i.e. Venmo, Revolut). Our goal is two-fold, 1) make crypto accessible to non-crypto natives by making it easy to get money on-chain and 2) push the boundaries of how advanced crypto techniques can be used for consumer applications. We believe that we can grow crypto adoption by tying usage closer to the apps people use every day already.\n\nAt the core of our mission is continuing to push new user adoption. We believe that these new cryptographic primitives open up novel ways for Web2 data to be used on-chain. However, these new primitives need to be built in such a way that they are viable for broader usage. Our major ongoing contributions to the space will be adapting / building the core infrastructure to be viable for broader consumption. The true magic of these cryptographic primitives can truly only be felt by enabling novel and worthwhile experiences that attract old and new users alike.\n\nWe are hoping to achieve this by experimenting with and advancing various other Ethereum Foundation initiatives for enabling development on top of ZK (ZKEmail) and MPC (TLSNotary). Such initiatives benefit the ecosystem by enabling next generation systems that are:\n - Sybil resistant: users prove information about themselves\n - Meaningful: users are transacting with real world assets they can prove ownership of\n - Trustless: users prove interactions they‚Äôve made instead of relying on intermediaries / oracles to resolve transactions\n\nOur first alpha product, the ZKP2P on-ramp, fills a gap in the on-ramping space where users are able to get money directly on-chain fast (no waiting for wires to clear or new accounts to be created with a third-party) while also being cheaper than other direct on-ramps on the market (ie Moonpay). We are able to achieve this by making our on-ramp a completely non-custodial, P2P marketplace. Since our marketplace is P2P, off-rampers compete to get off-chain by setting lower USDC <> fiat swap rates to entice on-rampers to take their liquidity. In many ways you can view our on-ramp as a Web2 <> Web3 version of UniswapV3. The high-level flow is as such:\n\n1. Liquidity providers on-chain (off-rampers) deposit funds into a Ramp contract \n2. On-rampers can then submit a transaction to place funds into escrow\n3. Once the funds are put into escrow the on-ramper can only unlock the on-chain funds for themselves if they are able to submit a valid proof of payment on a Web2 payment network.\n\nCurrently, we support Venmo, Revolut, HDFC (UPI), and BBVA Garanti which gives us coverage for USD, EUR, GBP, SGD, INR, and TRY with more to come. Proofs of transactions on these networks are generated by on-rampers providing data related to their off-chain payment to our zero-knowledge circuits. Using zero-knowledge circuits allows us to verify transaction data without the user needing to leak sensitive data to the public.\n\nWe strongly believe that as we continue to improve the tech, on-ramps like these not only provide a stronger and more resilient alternative for on-ramping, they also are better able to meet users where they are at, the payment platforms they use everyday. Furthermore, our P2P Marketplace can be extended to far more than just fiat <> crypto swaps. We can extend this framework to other items like tickets and gaming items, reducing fees on secondary marketplaces and providing stronger protection against scams. Consequently we can unlock value for non-speculators and give more people a reason to transact on-chain!\n"

Recently, I have harnessed the power of artificial intelligence to create ceramic visuals and transformed these unique pieces into an NFT collection. My project aims to merge the aesthetics and texture of traditional ceramic art with the creative potential of AI, exploring the new boundaries of art in the digital age.\n\nAbout My Project\nThe main goal of my project is to combine the creative power of AI with ceramic art, offering art lovers and collectors innovative and original digital artworks. Each NFT in my collection features high-resolution digital representations of AI-generated ceramic visuals. These pieces represent a fusion of modern technology with traditional craftsmanship, creating unique art forms that celebrate the best of both worlds.\n\nWhy AI and Ceramics?\nCeramic art has a rich history spanning thousands of years, with each piece reflecting the artist's labor and creativity. In this project, I aimed to add a new dimension to ceramic art by utilizing AI's creative capabilities. The AI algorithms analyze traditional ceramic designs and generate unique and creative visuals. As a result, each NFT becomes an art piece that blends traditional art forms with cutting-edge technology.\n\nWhy It Matters to Optimism Collective\nOptimism Collective, as an ecosystem supporting decentralized and community-focused projects, offers great opportunities for artists like me. Developing this project on Optimism allows me to bring AI-based art and NFTs to a wider audience. Additionally, Optimism's fast and low-cost transactions enable more efficient interactions between collectors and artists.\n\nFuture Plans\nI plan to expand this collection further, enriching it with different ceramic techniques and styles. Moreover, I aim to collaborate with other innovative projects in the fields of AI and art to create a broader and more diverse digital art collection. By working within the Optimism ecosystem, I look forward to developing community-driven projects and bringing together artists and collectors.\n\nThank you for the opportunity to introduce my project. I am excited to be on this journey of bringing AI and ceramic art into the digital world with you.\n\nBest regards,\nRembase"
