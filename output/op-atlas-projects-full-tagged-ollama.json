Act specifications are a formal, high-level description of all possible behaviours of an EVM program. Act allows many existing general purpose verification tools to be leveraged to prove properties about the specification. Such tools include SMT solvers (cvc5, z3, bitwuzla), theorem provers (Coq) and economic analysis tooling (CheckMate, Open Games). Act specifications can be automatically proved equivalent to concrete implementations in EVM. For very simple contracts, Act specifications can be automatically generated from EVM bytecode.\n\nThis is an end-to-end pipeline that supports principled reasoning about high level properties of EVM bytecode. It supports reasoning about both correctness (e.g. accounting invariants) and economic properties (e.g. incentive compatibility). Act specifications serve as a high-level smart contract representation, allowing for easy integration of existing general purpose analysis and verification tooling into the EVM context.",

    "name": "Aderyn",
    "description": "Aderyn is an open-source, public-good developer tool. It is a Rust-based solidity smart contract static analyzer designed to help protocol engineers and security researchers find vulnerabilities in Solidity code bases.\n\nAderyn integrates seamlessly into small and enterprise-level development workflows. It offers lightning-fast, command-line static analysis functionality and a framework for building custom detectors that adapt to any Solidity codebase.\n\nAderyn does three things really well:‚Äç‚Äç‚Äç\nIdentify Solidity Smart contract vulnerabilities: Cyfrin Aderyn quickly identifies potential vulnerabilities in Solidity code and highlights parts of the codebase for further investigation.\n\nSupports building custom detectors to suit your needs: Protocols and security researchers can use the Cyfrin Aderyn framework to build custom vulnerability detectors for any Solidity codebase.\n\nIdentify known issues and protect OP value: Competitive auditing platforms can use Cyfrin Aderyn to detect and filter out known issues inside protocol codebases, protecting customers' and auditors' time and value.\n\nWho is it for?\n\n1. Developers\nAs a new generation of developers enters the space, we (the security community) are responsible for using our knowledge and experience to create tools that facilitate secure development practices. We need to make it easy to avoid repeating past mistakes.\n\nFrom a developer's perspective, the cost of finding bugs in Solidity code is exorbitantly high. Engaging top-tier security firms like Cyfrin Private Audits or competitive audit platforms like CodeHawks requires serious cash. That's because the security knowledge required to stamp out bugs is pooled among security firms and competitive auditors, who are in demand.\n\nWe must drive the cost of finding bugs, especially the common and known ones, towards zero by creating tools that make development secure by nature.\n\nAderyn is built for lightning-fast, open-source static analysis that hooks into the existing development workflow.\n\n2. Security Researchers\nSecurity Researchers are the knowledge guardians of the on-chain world. They are the people you engage with when you're undergoing an audit. Many auditors start every audit with a long checklist. They read through the codebase, ensuring the code doesn't violate any items on their list. If it does, it's an issue for the report. Once they've finished with this list, they get creative and try out other techniques.\n\nAderyn's detector framework enables Security Researchers to encode the patterns they look for in their checklist into Aderyn detectors. By doing this, the research community can focus on the deeper, more complex bugs, knowing that tooling has uncovered the repetitive checklist of issues so they don't have to.\n\nDevelopers write more secure code before they engage Security Researchers, and when they do, the Researchers can spend more time on complex bugs instead of manually checking for easy fixes.\n\nWhat makes Aderyn unique vs similar tools?\nSpeed: Real-time feedback as you‚Äôre coding with the upcoming vscode extension.\n\nCutting-edge detectors: The detectors are built from the latest findings from external and in-house auditors. This means developers can harness the power of an audit team at their fingertips for free!\n\n‚ÄúAuditor Mode‚Äù: Helps auditors find specific areas and concepts within a codebase to dig further. For example, ‚ÄúShow me all of the instances in which this storage slot is altered‚Äù.\n\nOpen-source: This tool is completely open-source and will be free for all developers in perpetuity. Cyfrin does not make money directly from it.\n\nAdoption of tool: Aderyn is now used by developers across the Superchain ecosystem and we are continuously building new custom detectors for developers. \n\nImportance of tool: Security is paramount for mass adoption. Without security, adding any TVL to the Superchain is risky. We want to support developers from day zero and provide real time security analysis whilst projects are being built.\n\nSuperchain interoperability: We want to ensure that when working cross chain, builders are doing so with secure frameworks. We also include building customer detectors for interoperability. \n\nWho are Cyfrin:\nCyfrin is the industry-leading smart contract education and security company. Home to 8,000 security researchers and a community of over 100,000 students and smart contract engineers, we provide audits, tools, and education to the world's biggest decentralized protocols, institutions, and products.\n\nCyfrin works closely with Optimism and the Superchain as a whitelisted security service provider. We want to continue adding value to the Optimims ecosystem. \n\nThis project refers specifically to Cyfrin's developer tool, Aderyn.",

    "description": "We have developed a signer proxy software that enables the OP Stack chain to use an external signer (currently supporting AWS KMS and YubiHSM) through the official signer client to signer the sequencer, batcher, proposer and challenger transactions. However, the official signer client does not integrate with external signers, so we have implemented this functionality in our signer proxy.\n\nCurrently, the process outlined in the Optimism documentation for setting up a sequencer, batcher, and proposer requires using plain private keys, creating an insecure environment for mainnet deployment. Although the documentation suggests using hardware security modules (HSMs) for key management, it lacks detailed guidance beyond referencing source code. Chain operators, particularly those using bare metal setups, often prefer YubiHSM2 over cloud-based solutions like AWS KMS due to its hardware-native security.\n\nTo enhance security, mainnet chain operators are encouraged to use industry-standard hardware signers like YubiHSM2 or AWS KMS. This approach allows operators to deploy Optimism stack chains securely by protecting private keys with hardware-based solutions. Existing resources, such as the integration of YubiHSM2 into the Keplr wallet and the TMKMS YubiHSM installer, provide relevant experiences that support this approach.\n\nOur AWS KMS Signer proxy has been used by the Lisk team for their op-challenger. We are working with them to make signer proxy perfect and production ready.",

These widgets can then be easily embedded in your docs or any react application for devs to query. This is instrumental for devrel teams, to help onboard external devs.\n\nPlayground: Our playground is a collaborative environment primarily for solidity and front-end devs to build applications. This can be used by internal engineering teams or teams across different organizations. Devrel teams can also take advantage of the playground to create a single source of truth for their protocol - making onboarding super easy for their developer community.\n\nProtocol Registry: Our protocol registry is an open-source tool that allows you to find different popular protocols and their respective playgrounds.\n\nOn a high level, bonadocs are created to simplify the documentation, interaction, and integration of smart contracts - similar to Postman and web APIs.\n\nTry it out: https://docs.bonadocs.com/\nPlayground demo: https://x.com/thisdavidboy/status/1854809292836339939",

    "description": "Runtime Verification is a leading formal verification company specializing in blockchain security and smart contract correctness. We've developed ERCx, the most comprehensive open-source testing library for ERC token standards, featuring over 500 individual tests across ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, and ERC-4626 implementations.\nERCx directly empowers Superchain builders by providing production-ready test suites that verify both standard compliance and security properties. Our library offers zero-configuration testing for deployed contracts via Foundry fork testing, plus simple integration for pre-deployment source code validation. With three testing tiers: Standard (EIP compliance), Security (vulnerability detection), and Features (implementation validation), developers can ship token contracts with confidence, knowing they've been thoroughly vetted against real-world attack vectors and edge cases.\nWhat makes ERCx particularly valuable for the Optimism ecosystem is its cross-chain compatibility and handling of complex deployment scenarios. The library seamlessly works across OP Stack chains and handles storage complexities that often challenge developers working with established tokens like USDC or stETH. By providing this critical testing infrastructure as open-source tooling, we're enabling safer, more reliable token implementations across the entire Superchain, directly supporting the ecosystem's growth while reducing the security risks that have historically plagued token contracts in DeFi.",

    "description": "IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer protocol designed to make the web faster, more open, and more resilient. By using content-addressed storage rather than location-based references, IPFS removes the need for centralized servers and allows files to be distributed and retrieved from multiple nodes around the world. This approach lowers hosting costs, improves data availability, and reduces censorship, laying the groundwork for a more secure and permanent global information network.\n\nIPFS is used in a variety of applications. While some users interact with IPFS via imported libraries in their projects, a large amount of usage comes via IPFS' HTTP Gateway API which allows users to self-host, use extensions like IPFS companion, or publicly run gateways (whether paid ones run by companies like Filebase, Pinata, etc. or the public goods services at ipfs.io and dweb.link).\n\nIPFS is a system for moving data across decentralized networks, with >11M weekly users and 250K public p2p nodes. Highlights:\n\n1. Off-chain storage. IPFS provides verifiable, off-chain storage, often used to reduce on-chain needs in Ethereum & Optimism. Examples: TrueBlocks (local IPFS-based index for EVM chains, built with grants from OP & EF), Snapshot (IPFS-based off-chain voting).\n\n2. Go-to distribution network for fully decentralized third-party app frontends (for gaming, DeFi, & more). We run gateway services that serve 900M requests/wk, and added native IPFS support to browsers like Chromium & Brave.\n\n3. NFT metadata gold standard. Over 115M NFTs are stored on IPFS, including leading platforms OpenSea (which supports Optimism NFTs), Rarible, and Zora.",

Our team has developed KEVM, the most complete and battle-tested formal semantics of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), written in the K Framework.\n\nKEVM is not just a specification, it is an executable specification that can be used to symbolically reason about smart contracts, run conformance tests, analyze gas usage, debug programs, and formally verify correctness properties. It passes the full Ethereum test suite and is used to verify high-value contracts, including ERC20 tokens in both Solidity and Vyper. We recently updated the semantics to support Pectra upgrade.\n\nKEVM is being actively utilized by Kontrol - our formal verification tool for Soldiity, which is actively used by leading teams in the EVM ecosystem, including Optimism, Ethereum Foundation, Lido, Uniswap, as well as security researchers and auditors across the broader Ethereum community.\n\nWe actively maintain this repository, contribute to Ethereum‚Äôs protocol evolution, and integrate with developer tooling like Foundry. Through KEVM, we are pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible in provably correct and secure smart contract infrastructure.",

    "description": "Runtime Verification has been at the forefront of open-source formal verification tools for more than a decade. Our generalistic approach allows us to use our technology on multiple blockchains. While KEVM offers our verification infrastructure to all EVM-based smart contracts, Kontrol greatly reduces the barrier to entry to formal verification for Solidity smart contracts.\nOur tooling is completely open source and freely accessible to all developers of the Optimism ecosystem at no additional cost.\n\nKEVM is an EVM executable formal semantics written in the K framework. KEVM passes all Ethereum conformance tests and is the entry point for formally verifying smart contracts with the K framework. However, using plain KEVM requires ad-hoc training on the K framework to write specifications. Additionally, these specifications can be quite verbose, increasing the difficulty of writing them.\n\nKontrol solves this by allowing developers to write the formal specification of their smart contracts directly as Foundry property tests. These tests are automatically translated into KEVM specifications, keeping all the verification guarantees whilst allowing for a much more easy developer experience.",

    "description": "What is it?\nMoccasin is an open source, public-good developer tool. It's a python-based Vyper smart contract development, deployment, and testing framework.\n\nWhy is it needed?\nThe Web3 Python ecosystem has been overshadowed by the Rust and Javascript ecosystems, which is a crucial misstep when all financial and AI developers use Python. Walk into any asset manager or hedge fund and ask the portfolio managers or traders what they are using, and the answer is Python. We need a fast and modern tool for Python exploration. \n\nVyper adds to smart contract language diversity, which is as important as having client diversity from the blockchain infrastructure. If one has a critical bug, we minimize the downside by having different languages.\n\nHow is it unique?\nMoccasin is the fastest Python framework and, for Vyper smart contracts, even outpaces Foundry in some instances. It achieves this speed by being built on the lightning-fast Titanoboa tool.\n\nYou can see a quick benchmark of compile time for Vyper contracts across popular frameworks like Apeworx and Foundry.\nhttps://github.com/Cyfrin/Moccasin/blob/main/docs/source/_static/stats-default.png?raw=true\n\nWhat can it do?\nEncrypt keys\nRun tests\nUnderstand deployment contexts\nAnd ideally work with the growing number of non-EVM compatible chains (ie, ZKsync, Scroll, etc)\nRun fuzzing campaigns\n\nMoccasin is a new tool, but due to its speed and developer friendliness, we expect to see its adoption skyrocket in the Python community.\nWhat really sets Moccasin apart, other than being the fastest and most developer-friendly Python tooling for Viper, is that developers can now script and perform DevOps in the user-friendly language Python.\n\nWhat is our roadmap?\nYou can see a list of 0.4.0 roadmap items (and other priority items) for Moccasin including:\nbetter multi-sig & hardware wallet integration\nin-line debugger\nSolidity support\nMedusa fuzzing\nbuillt-in halmos or HEVM support\n\nWho is it for?\nPython developers. According to the Stack Overflow 2024 survey, python is the #1 programming language for new developers.\nSo, Moccasin is for new developers.\nAccording to Upwork, Python is the #1 language for people working in AI.\nSo, Moccasin is for AI developers.\nAccording to Columbia Engineering, python is the #1 language for fintech.\nSo, Moccasin is for financial developers, including DeFi.\nThis tool is meant for both new and advanced developers - a tool that is easy to pick up and powerful enough for professional applications. (edited) \n\nWith this tool, we want to start bridging the gap between web2 and web3 developers and encourage builders to move into our industry. Allowing developers to use multiple languages and to grow the adoption of the Sueprchain.  \n",

    "description": "Opti.Domains has developed an ENS Gateway implementation for OP Stack chains that supports various proofs, including those from L2OutputOracle, Dispute Game, and Anchor State. The appropriate proof is automatically selected based on the configuration of the OP Stack chain.\n\nThe Opti.Domains ENS Gateway automatically upgrades in response to the OP Stack's transition from L2OutputOracle to Dispute Game, requiring no manual intervention or updates to the verifier contract or gateway server.\n\nThe ENS Gateway, specifically the EVMGateway, enables trustless cross-chain data retrieval for ENS names deployed on Layer 2 networks like Optimism with a CCIP Gateway. When an ENS name lookup occurs, the resolver reverts with OffchainLookup containing the gateway URL. The client then contacts the gateway, which returns the requested data. This data is passed to a callback function on the resolver for verification before being returned to the client as the final result of the name lookup.\n\nOur ENS Gateway has a mechanism to ensure liveliness even in the event that the respected dispute game type has suddenly changed, as seen in the recent proposal, 'Upgrade Proposal #10: Granite Network Upgrade,' by storing a backup dispute game type and only trusting its anchor state.\n\nOpti.Domains has also developed social verification and attestation to EAS in collaboration with Bored Town. We are on our way to scaling ENS to OP. We have contributed to the ENS OP Gateway development, which is currently under review by ENS core developers.\n\nThe Namespace team has expressed interest and reached out to us with questions about using our OP ENS Gateway. Additionally, several teams have participated in discussions regarding the development of our OP ENS Gateway.",

Over the past 3 years, I‚Äôve worked on several experimental projects and have been a 3-time ETHGlobal finalist.

    "description": "Rundler (Rust Bundler) is an ERC-4337 bundler implementation written in Rust. Rundler is designed to achieve high-performance and high-reliability in cloud deployments via a modular architecture. Currently, both Alchemy and Coinbase‚Äôs Base team use Rundler. It powers >70% of UOs in the Ethereum ecosystem and a vast majority of UOs in the Superchain. Rundler is OSS licensed with GPL.\n\nRundler powers the ERC-4337 ecosystem with an implementation that users can rely on to scale reliably. Rundler open source code repo has 300+ stars, more than 50 forks. \n\nOur goals with Rundler:\n\nERC-4337 Specification Compliance: Rundler strives to implement the full ERC-4337 specification and to maintain support as the specification changes and new onchain components are released. This includes new Entry Point contract support, support for the upcoming P2P mempool specification, support for alternative mempools, and more.\nBest-in-class Performance and Reliability: Rundler strives to power the most demanding workloads in cloud environments. Rust was chosen for its high performance and memory safety. Rundler's modular architecture lets providers choose to run the stateless components (RPC, builder) in a fully horizontally scalable manner connecting to the stateful components (mempool, p2p, event cache) via the network. Rundler's bundle builder is designed to be able to support the full gas throughput of the network it's building for.\nExtensibility/Chain Support: ERC-4337 is designed to support any EVM chain. However, different EVM supporting networks have different rules around how to support things like gas usage, gas fees, precompiles, etc. Rundler is designed to be extensible and easily adapted to support any EVM chain.\nModularity: Rundler is written in a modular manner, allowing its components to be run as a single integrated binary, or as a distributed system. Rundler also strives for its individual crates to be used to support future ERC-4337 tooling.\n\nIn RPGF Round 3, Alchemy was awarded a total of 74,534 $OP across Rundler, Light Account, ERC-6900, aa-sdk, and various informational pieces put out to the public domain to further adoption of smart accounts in the Superchain.",

Its strength lies in its flexibility and high customization, catering to the diverse needs of its users.

Unlike the original Snapshot, Snapshot X operates fully onchain using a set of modular smart contracts. This shift makes Snapshot censorship resistant, with onchain and cross-chain voting power computation and trustless execution, while keeping gas costs to the minimal extent possible.",

It aggregates over 8,000 smart contract vulnerability reports, bug bounty opportunities, and security audits from top firms like Cyfrin, OpenZeppelin and Trail of Bits, alongside contributions from individual researchers. Solodit not only aggregates this information but also makes it actionable, equipping developers and auditors with tools to prevent exploits and enhance the safety of dapps.\n\nWhy is it needed?\nThe web3 ecosystem is plagued by billions of dollars in losses due to security breaches in smart contracts and protocols. Despite the availability of security knowledge, it is fragmented across various platforms and reports, making it inaccessible to most developers and security teams. There are several problems that Solodit solves:\n\nKnowledge Gap: Many teams deploy smart contracts without understanding past vulnerabilities, leading to repeat incidents.\nInefficiencies: Developers and auditors spend valuable time searching disparate sources for security insights.\nEconomic Impact: Preventable exploits undermine trust in web3, stalling adoption and investment.\n\nBy aggregating and structuring security data, Solodit enables proactive vulnerability management and risk mitigation in the Web3 ecosystem.\n\nHow is it unique?\nComprehensive Coverage: Aggregates findings from leading auditors and platforms, offering unmatched insights into vulnerabilities and bug bounties.\nActionable Insights: Goes beyond archiving reports by providing advanced search tools and tagging systems to contextualise risks and solutions.\nCommunity-Driven Enhancements: Facilitates collaboration via ratings, tagging, and leaderboards that recognise top contributors, fostering a thriving security community.\nEducational Resource: This site serves as a learning hub for developers and auditors, providing real-world case studies on blockchain security.\n\nSolodit is a multipurpose tool designed to:\nMitigate Risk: Helps developers avoid known vulnerabilities, reducing the likelihood of exploits.\nPromote Proactive Security: Enables protocols to adopt preventive measures by studying historical vulnerabilities.\nStreamline Bug Bounties: Simplifies participation in bounty programs, encouraging more ethical hackers to contribute to ecosystem security.\nFoster Skill Development: Supports auditors in honing their skills and staying updated on emerging threats.\nSupport Decision-Making: Assists protocols in evaluating auditors via its leaderboard, promoting accountability and quality audits.\n\nWho is it for?\nDevelopers: Seeking to secure their smart contracts and understand vulnerability trends.\nAuditors: Looking to access a comprehensive repository of findings and showcase their expertise.\nWhitehat Hackers: Interested in participating in bug bounty programs and contributing to web3 security.\nProtocol P&E teams: Aiming to assess risks and prevent costly exploits.\nEducators and Researchers: Teaching or studying blockchain security with real-world examples, e.g. Cyfrin Updraft. \n\nStill to come:\nUI/UX redesign\nPower Aderyn, static analysis support",

It is 100% open-source, with all levels contributed by players.\n\nIn 2024, we have continued expanding the game, adding four new advanced levels‚ÄîHigherOrder, Stake, Impersonator, and Magic Animal Carousel‚Äîwhich explore current vulnerabilities in smart contract development. These levels introduce challenges related to low-level EVM programming, staking vulnerabilities, signature verification exploits, and bitwise manipulation attacks, pushing players to deepen their understanding of Ethereum security.\n\nBeyond new levels, we have also redesigned the UI, added support for multiple networks, and expanded language translations to make the game more accessible to a global audience.\n\nWe believe that The Ethernaut is an essential training tool for developers across the Ethereum ecosystem, including those building on the Optimism network. By continually evolving the game with new challenges and features, we strive to make smart contract security education engaging, practical, and accessible to everyone.",

    "name": "Trash NFTs",
    "description": "Trash NFTs is a project built on Base that leverages the unique properties of the ERC404 token standard. We had the idea for Trash NFTs as a way to combine artichokelord‚Äôs incredible artwork with novel tech to create something fun that pushed the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible for a memecoin. We chose to build Trash NFTs on Base because we believe in the future of the Superchain and the supportive community of builders it fosters.\n\nBetween the two contracts associated with Trash NFTs, the project has generated over 1300 onchain transactions.\n\nDemo video: https://youtu.be/KORe_xnJx1w?si=6V52TlkOfLz3hySz\nVideo of artichokelord drawing the art: https://warpcast.com/trashnfts/0xc65d2a4e\n\nERC404 is an experimental token standard pioneered by Pandora on February 2, 2024. ERC404 tokens embrace characteristics of both ERC20 and ERC721 tokens: They are ‚Äúsemi-fungible,‚Äù enabling both highly liquid markets and uniqueness within a single asset. This allows collectors to sell their tokens when they want and in pieces, if they‚Äôd like, as well as introduces the ability to reroll your NFT traits by making more transactions. ERC404s are inherently fractionalized and designed to work natively with existing DeFi protocols. While innovative, it‚Äôs important to note that ERC404 is also experimental.\n\nWhen we first launched $TRASH, we forked Pandora‚Äôs contract and raced to be one of the first, if not the first project to deploy an ERC404 on Base. Pandora‚Äôs contract was limited to 5 variations of artwork, images that implied a reveal down the line, so we followed suit with 5 closed-lid NFTs of different rarities. Our next goal was to have a PFP collection with the lids removed, so we came up with the idea to create a new contract where you could stash your $TRASH and mint a Dumpster Diver. This contract is named The Dumpster. It is open source and available to any other ERC404 token that wishes to fork it to enable their holders to redeem their ERC404 token for an ERC721.\n\nIn addition to the ability to mint an ERC721 by depositing an ERC404, the Dumpster contract enables holders of Dumpster Divers PFP tokens to burn their ERC721 to redeem the original ERC404 that the ERC721 was minted with (retaining the rarity and token ID). A small cleaning fee (0.00042069 ETH, updatable by governance) is charged, and this mechanism can also be used for regenerating/rerolling or ‚Äòrecycling‚Äô, Dumpster Diver PFPs to get the desired traits.\n\nWe have grown to 185 holders and have generated $44k from trade fees (50% of which is $TRASH and 100% of which is reinvested in providing liquidity for our pools), and 1,654,148 DEGEN (~$40k) from liquidity mining rewards. We were also a finalist in the Backdrop Build V3 Accelerator Program (top 5% of applicants). \n\nTrash NFTs have built an effective machine: by owning the LPs that facilitate the swaps into $TRASH we capture 1% of the volume and store that in our treasury. We have two liquidity pools: 1) TRASH/ETH and 2) TRASH/ DEGEN, the rapidly growing meme token with utility in the Farcaster network and beyond. This exposes Trash NFTs to volatility, which generates more revenue because arbitrage bots stabilize the price across pools. \n\nTrash NFTs is also governed by a DAO called Waste Management that was initially allocated 20% of all $TRASH tokens. This DAO collects the cleaning fees associated with trait rerolls as well as the transaction fees and LP rewards from its DeFi activities. Finally, Trash NFTs has entered the meatspace by hosting a trash pickup event during Farcon 2024 with /humankind. \n\nWe are proud of Trash NFTs, as it has maintained and proven to be a sound investment for its holder base while operating successfully. There are definite improvements we continue working toward: 1) expanding growth efforts to the broader 404 ecosystem with partnerships (such as Scattering.io with which we have built a relationship) and promotion, 2) revamping The Dumpster website for a more seamless experience and 3) engaging the community to take leadership in expanding the DAO.",

Morgan, Fnality and NTT Data\n- Web3 infrastructure companies such as Alchemy \n- The Besu Ethereum Execution client\n- It's even been integrated natively into the Android OS by Freedom Factory in ethOS which powers the  upcoming Ethereum phone the DGEN1\n\nWe decided in 2024 to bring Web3j into the Hyperledger Foundation, which provides high-quality governance of open source (similar to the Apache Foundation). It's still, the same team at Web3 Labs responsible for maintaining and supporting the library for its wide and varied user base. The Hyperledger association is great for visibility, but doesn't provide any funding for the project!\n\nWe rely on grant funding to sustain this library and hopeful to qualify for this RPGF round.\n\nUnfortunately, we missed out on OP RPGF 3 as we had not realised projects were eligible for multiple rounds so did not apply following our success in OP RPGF 2.\n\nüôèüèª",

It is designed to be small, fast, and easily embedded in wallets or runnable locally with any provider. Some things WhatsABI can do: Return selectors from bytecode, look up function signatures from selectors, provide helpers for looking up ABI and signatures from public databases (like Sourcify, Etherscan, Blockscout, OpenChain, 4Byte), resolve onchain proxies (including inspecting available diamond facets!), loading contract metadata, and more.  \n\nWhatsABI is already powering many popular projects like: Otterscan, Sourcify, Rivet, Ondora, Thirdweb, and more coming soon as we collaborate on integrations upstream.",
