Building on this foundation, we introduced during 2024 and 2025 specialized repositories—Community Contracts for experimental features like ERC-7786 cross-chain messaging, Contracts Wizard for interactive contract creation, Contracts Upgradeable for evolving deployments, Upgrades and Upgrades plugins for streamlined proxy management, Merkle Tree for advanced proof generation, and Subgraphs for indexing on-chain activity. Each extension serves a distinct role while complementing the main library’s rigorous security standards, broadening developers’ capabilities across interoperable and upgradeable scenarios.\n\nBy integrating advanced features such as cross-chain asset transfers, modular accounts, and streamlined deployment flows, this suite aligns closely with Optimism’s 2025 intent to foster cross-chain interactions. In particular, ERC‑7786 aims to unify multi-chain messaging protocols, facilitating frictionless interoperability between networks. \n\nCombined with the shared focus on secure, upgradeable development and open collaboration, OpenZeppelin’s tooling empowers builders to innovate confidently on Optimism and beyond, driving the ecosystem toward broader Superchain adoption."

It is also one of the top 500 projects (by dependants) on NPM.\n\nIt was written and is maintained by me, RicMoo (Richard Moore), a random developer from Canada that is passionate about open-source and dedicates most his waking-time (and some sleeping-time) to it.\n\nHack the Planet! :)"

I am fascinated by the possibility of worlds without owner: Autonomous World\n\nI setup a company of which I am the sole owner and member: Etherplay. And with it I set up to explore this exciting new domain. While this is currently only me, it will hopefully grow into something bigger as time goes by.\n\nThe games built are \n- https://ethernal.land\n- https://conquest.game\n- https://stratagems.world\n- https://catacombs.world\n\nAll these game are open-source.\n\nTo build these game I had to build tools to support them. This includes hardhat-deploy, FUZD, clones-with-immutables, ethereum-indexer, missiv and more"

It offers efficient implementations of commonly-used libraries, such as MerkleProofLib, alongside cutting-edge features like LibZip.\n\nBy thoughtfully encapsulating low-level inline assembly within flexible APIs, Solady simplifies the process of writing clean and efficient Solidity code. More than just a library, Solady also serves as a learning resource and experimental laboratory for pioneering gas-optimization techniques.\n\nSolady is used in the codebases of Optimism and Coinbase.\n\nWith respect to the OP stack, Solady contributes in the following ways:\n- Provides a Solidity and JavaScript implementation of FastLZ compression algorithm, which is used for more accurate gas estimations in the Fjord upgrade. The JavaScript code is very minimal, allowing for it's easy translation into Go.\n- Various other utilities such as bytecode proxies and string operations."

      "description": "IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer protocol designed to make the web faster, more open, and more resilient. By using content-addressed storage rather than location-based references, IPFS removes the need for centralized servers and allows files to be distributed and retrieved from multiple nodes around the world. This approach lowers hosting costs, improves data availability, and reduces censorship, laying the groundwork for a more secure and permanent global information network.\n\nIPFS is used in a variety of applications. While some users interact with IPFS via imported libraries in their projects, a large amount of usage comes via IPFS' HTTP Gateway API which allows users to self-host, use extensions like IPFS companion, or publicly run gateways (whether paid ones run by companies like Filebase, Pinata, etc. or the public goods services at ipfs.io and dweb.link).\n\nIPFS is a system for moving data across decentralized networks, with >11M weekly users and 250K public p2p nodes. Highlights:\n\n1. Off-chain storage. IPFS provides verifiable, off-chain storage, often used to reduce on-chain needs in Ethereum & Optimism. Examples: TrueBlocks (local IPFS-based index for EVM chains, built with grants from OP & EF), Snapshot (IPFS-based off-chain voting).\n\n2. Go-to distribution network for fully decentralized third-party app frontends (for gaming, DeFi, & more). We run gateway services that serve 900M requests/wk, and added native IPFS support to browsers like Chromium & Brave.\n\n3. NFT metadata gold standard. Over 115M NFTs are stored on IPFS, including leading platforms OpenSea (which supports Optimism NFTs), Rarible, and Zora."

It is a pioneering tool in web3 end-to-end testing with the potential to evolve into a decentralized network of test runners and continuous integration providers in the future. Synpress is easy to use, fully tested, and includes features such as MetaMask support, headless mode, integrated video recording, and many more.
